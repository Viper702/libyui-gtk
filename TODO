/* List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues */

= Regression testing =

* Setup LDTP to run through all the tests/ and provoke as many
  code-paths as possible

= Look and feel =

* BarGraph / RatioBox
  Let tiny widgets still have some pixels visible for popup menu.

* YGRichText should use GtkHtml when available, so that we get support for
  tables.

* Accessibility and internationalization (from the package selector) needs to be
  implemented.

= Package Selector =
(this little monster diserves a section of its own. =))

* Packages list
	+ different versions of a package should probably be available through
	  a node rather than the popup menu.

* Categories view
	+ hide nodes that have no children on categories view

	+ some simple simple syncing. Like when the user presses the Amusement
	  row or a package from it, the same row should be expanded and set in
	  the visible area as well.

	+ allow multi-selections on a given view, so that the user could keep
	  pressing control or use shift. (GtkTreeSelection allows for this.)

	+ when the user presses Alt+I (for the button mnemonic), we probably want the
	  focus to stay on the view, so that the user can choose more... A shortcut for
	  just the I and R keys would also be good.

* Patterns
	+ we probably should re-design this interface a bit to make it more intuitive.
	  Like using two install / remove buttons rather than the check boxes. Per item
	  or global? We probably should also provide a re-install / auto-update button.

* Patch selector (YOU)
	+ we should also list installed patches and maybe a way to remove them
	  (downgrade of version should work for most cases -- check how qt does it).
	  Probably a tab for this?

* Others
	* we should let user see disk usage. Unlike yast-qt, which displays it on
	  its entirely, maybe we could have use a combo box and only display the
	  size used for that partition. Or maybe use an expander.

= Internal affairs =

* IntField / Slider
	o to consider: only report value change when the widget is stalled.
		To use g_idle functionality.

* Timezone
	Accept - & timezone selection foo ...

= Yast-Core =

* Stock images for wizard
	Already patched stock icons supports for regular button (even if not
	currently being used), but not for wizard ones.

* Button order
	Should be possible to specify button order. eg: [Ok] [Cancel] vs [Cancel] [Ok]
	We could hack this through if we had stock images support (may depend
	on the way they are implemented).
