/* List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues */

= Regression testing =

* Setup LDTP to run through all the tests/ and provoke as many
  code-paths as possible

= Look and feel =

* (YGBarGraph / RatioBox): let tiny widgets still have some pixels visible
  for popup menu.

* (YGRichText) should use GtkHtml when available, so that we get support for
  tables.

* (RatioBox) Our buttons are too big in some dialogs (eg. run disk.ycp as user).
  Check where our algorithm differs from yast-core's.

* (YGTextEntry / YGMultiLineEdit) Add undo/redo support. The backend code should
  be shared. We probably want to make an interface for it that is then implemented
  by those two GTK widgets. Work out a patch for GTK+.

= Package Selector =
(this little monster diserves a section of its own. =))

* Patch selector (YOU)
	+ we should also list installed patches and maybe a way to remove them
	  (downgrade of version should work for most cases -- check how qt does it).
	  Probably a tab for this?

* Internationalization needs to be supported.

* Search syntax: add proper Google syntax support. Consider also adding regex
  support when Glib ships with it (add radio boxes to entry's context menu).

* Re-work Yast face to Jakub's suggestion; make it configurable.

* We need an easter-egg! :)

= Internal affairs =

* IntField / Slider
	o to consider: only report value change when the widget is stalled.
		To use g_idle functionality.

= Yast-Core =

* Stock images for wizard
	Already patched stock icons supports for regular button (even if not
	currently being used), but not for wizard ones.

* Button order
	Should be possible to specify button order. eg: [Ok] [Cancel] vs [Cancel] [Ok]
	We could hack this through if we had stock images support (may depend
	on the way they are implemented).
