/* List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues */

= Regression testing =

* Setup LDTP to run through all the tests/ and provoke as many
  code-paths as possible

= Look and feel =

* YGRichText: should use GtkHtml when available, so that we get support for
  tables.

* YGTextEntry / YGMultiLineEdit: Add undo/redo support. The backend code should
  be shared. We probably want to make an interface for it that is then implemented
  by those two GTK widgets. Work out a patch for GTK+.

= Package Selector =
(this little monster diserves a section of its own. =))

* Search syntax: add proper Google syntax support. Consider also adding regex
  support when Glib ships with it (add radio boxes to entry's context menu).

= Yast-Core =

* Stock icons for buttons (at least the wizard ones)
    Currently the support is limited to English because it's done by comparing
    the strings to a list of stock icon ones.

* Button order
	Should be possible to specify button order. eg: [Ok] [Cancel] vs [Cancel] [Ok]
	We could hack this through if we had stock images support (may depend
	on the way they are implemented).
