/* List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues */

Bugs

	tests/Layout-TruncatedWidget.ycp
		unlike yast2-qt, we trigger recalculation events on widget property
		changes like the label or the button text.
	Difficulty: High - Priority: Low

	Honor YDialog's YWizardDialog directive
		see bug 457758. We also want to make multiple Wizard instances
		share the same help window. Overall, move a bunch of YGWizard
		stuff into YGDialog domain.
	Difficulty: Medium - Priority: Low

Enhancements

	Package manager search syntax
		add proper Google syntax support. Consider also adding regex (add
		radio boxes to entry's context menu).
	Difficulty: Medium - Priority: Low

	YGTextEntry / YGMultiLineEdit
		Add undo/redo support. (Possibly work out a patch for GTK+.)
	Difficulty: Low - Priority: Medium

	YGtkFindEntry
		Deprecate YGtkFindEntry usage in favor of GTK 2.16 GtkEntry new
		APIs. Notice the requirements for the Package Manager: change
		icon to reflect that of the context menu, and show arrow next
		to the search icon.
	Difficulty: Low - Priority: Low

	YGPackageSelector.cc: FlexPane class
		Deprecate in favor of GTK 2.16 GtkOrientation API for GtkPaned.
	Difficulty: Low - Priority: Low

Build procedure

	YGRichText
		should use GtkHtml when available, so that we get support for tables.
	Difficulty: -- - Priority: Medium

	libpy2gtk_pkg.so
		subtract the package manager code into a plugin.
	Difficulty: -- - Priority: Low

Test Framework

	Regression tests
		setup LDTP to run through all the tests/ and provoke as many code-paths
		as possible.
	Difficulty: -- - Priority: Low
