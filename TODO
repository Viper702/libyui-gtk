/* List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues */

= Look and feel =

* BarGraph / RatioBox
  Let tiny widgets still have some pixels visible for popup menu.

* YGRichText should use GtkHtml when available, so that we get support for
  tables.

* Accessibility and internationalization (from the package selector) needs to be
  implemented.

= Package Selector =
(this little monster diserves a section of its own. =))

* Packages list
	+ different versions of a package should probably be available through
	  a node rather than the popup menu.

* Categories view
	+ hide nodes that have no children on categories view

	+ some simple simple syncing. Like when the user presses the Amusement
	  row or a package from it, the same row should be expanded and set in
	  the visible area as well.

	+ allow multi-selections on a given view, so that the user could keep
	  pressing control or use shift. (GtkTreeSelection allows for this.)

	+ when the user presses Alt+I (for the button mnemonic), we probably want the
	  focus to stay on the view, so that the user can choose more... A shortcut for
	  just the I and R keys would also be good.

* Patterns
	+ we probably should re-design this interface a bit to make it more intuitive.
	  Like using two install / remove buttons rather than the check boxes. Per item
	  or global? We probably should also provide a re-install / auto-update button.

* Patch selector (YOU)
	+ we should also list installed patches and maybe a way to remove them
	  (downgrade of version should work for most cases -- check how qt does it).
	  Probably a tab for this?

* Others
	+ sometimes scrollbars are not presented on the package information.
	  We already do some work arounds so that GtkScrolledWindow scrollbars are
	  recalculated when an expander is pressed (it, or the GtkViewPort, inside
	  doesn't seem to deal well with dynamic containers), but there is some weird
	  case still to fix...

	* we should let user see disk usage. Unlike yast-qt, which displays it on
	  its entirely, maybe we could have use a combo box and only display the
	  size used for that partition. Or maybe use an expander.

= Internal affairs =

* IntField / Slider
	o to consider: only report value change when the widget is stalled.
		To use g_idle functionality.

* Timezone
	Accept - & timezone selection foo ...

= Yast-Core =

* Stock images for wizard
	Already patched stock icons supports for regular button (even if not
	currently being used), but not for wizard ones.

* Simple dialogs API
	So that we could display native dialogs.
