A native GTK+ YaST2 UI !

  This code creates a GTK+ plugin for YaST2. This plugin parallel
  installs with everything else, and will never be used unless
  explicitely invoked on the yast2 command line - ie. it won't break
  your system; go-on you know you want to install it.

Build pre-requisites

  To make this compile you'll need the following packages installed
  (at a minimum):

  yast2-devtools yast2-core-devel libzypp libzypp-devel gettext-devel

  They all are distributed with Suse's CDs.

Building / Installing

  make -f Makefile.cvs
  make && sudo make install [1]

  [1] - if you want sudo not to ask you a password, add yourself to the
        wheel group, and uncomment the related lines in /etc/sudoers

Running

  /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base /usr/share/doc/packages/yast2-core/libyui/examples/HelloWorld.ycp gtk

  From OpenSuse 10.3 on, it should be picked up automatically if you use Gnome. 
  For other desktops, you can set yast-gtk to be used by editing /etc/sysconfig/yast2 .

  In case of oddness append --nothreads to the cmdline,
  Also check the log file: ~/.y2log
