* the very beginnings of a native gtk+ YaST2 UI *

    This code creates a gtk+ plugin for YaST2. This plugin parallel
installs with everything else, and will never be used unless
explicitely invoked on the yast2 command line - ie. it won't break
your system; go-on you know you want to install it.

** build pre-requisites:

    To make this compile you'll need the following packages installed
(at a minimum):

    yast2-devel yast2-devtools yast2-core-devel

** to build / install

./autogen.sh # NB. don't pass --prefix [1]
make && sudo make install

[1] - the YaST2 auto-foo system uses ${prefix}/include/YaST2 to
      find the yast2-core-devel headers (sigh)

** running:

   /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base /usr/share/doc/packages/yast2-core/libyui/examples/HelloWorld.ycp gtk

Also working fairly well:
    Label1 Label2 Label3 Label4 Label1_de Label1_ja Label1_cs
    Spacing1 PushButton1 PushButton2
    ProgressBar1 ProgressBar2 ProgressBar3
    Frame1


Label - text needs escaping for shortcuts too (?) [uh?]
checkout yast2.txt for notes.

In case of oddness append --nothreads to the cmdline,
Also check the log file: ~/.y2log
