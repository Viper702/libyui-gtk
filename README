A native GTK+ YaST2 UI !

  This code creates a GTK+ plugin for YaST2. This plugin parallel
  installs with everything else, and will never be used unless
  explicitely invoked on the yast2 command line - ie. it won't break
  your system; go-on you know you want to install it.

Build pre-requisites

  To make this compile you'll need the following packages installed
  (at a minimum):

  yast2-devel yast2-devtools yast2-core-devel libzypp libzypp-devel

  They all are distributed with Suse's CDs.

Building / Installing

  ./autogen.sh              [1]
  make && sudo make install [2]

  [1] - don't pass "--prefix" as the YaST2 auto-foo system uses
        ${prefix}/include/YaST2 to find the yast2-core-devel headers (sigh)

  [2] - if you want sudo not to ask you a password, add yourself to the
        wheel group, and uncomment the related lines in /etc/sudoers

Running

  /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base /usr/share/doc/packages/yast2-core/libyui/examples/HelloWorld.ycp gtk

  In order to fire up YaST modules, run the ycc.sh script.
  (You'll need the zenity package installed.)

  In case of oddness append --nothreads to the cmdline,
  Also check the log file: ~/.y2log
