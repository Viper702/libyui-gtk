* the very beginnings of a native gtk+ YaST2 UI *

    This code creates a gtk+ plugin for YaST2. This plugin parallel
installs with everything else, and will never be used unless
explicitely invoked on the yast2 command line - ie. it won't break
your system; go-on you know you want to install it.

** build pre-requisites:

    To make this compile you'll need the following packages installed
(at a minimum):

    yast2-devel yast2-devtools yast2-core-devel

** to build / install

./autogen.sh # NB. don't pass --prefix [1]
make && sudo make install [2]

[1] - the YaST2 auto-foo system uses ${prefix}/include/YaST2 to
      find the yast2-core-devel headers (sigh)

[2] - if you want sudo not to ask you a password, add yourself to the
      wheel group, and uncomment the related lines in /etc/sudoers

** running:

/usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base /usr/share/doc/packages/yast2-core/libyui/examples/HelloWorld.ycp gtk

Also working fairly well:
    Label* Spacing* PushButton* ProgressBar* Frame*
    RadioButton* CheckBox* TextEntry[1-4,6] ComboBox[1-3]
    IntField*

Label - text needs escaping for shortcuts too (?) [uh?]
checkout yast2.txt for notes.

In case of oddness append --nothreads to the cmdline,
Also check the log file: ~/.y2log
