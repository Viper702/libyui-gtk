2006-11-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGLayout.cc & YGWidget.cc: changed layout code to use
	our own GTK based solution for the layout rather than
	the YWidget provided one. Still some minor problems, but
	it is working pretty well. The code actually was reduced
	in size because we no longer need the setSize and nicesize,
	which were also easily broken code.

	The layout uses YGtkRatioBox for the YSplit to support
	weights. Each widget is contained in a YGtkMinSize, that
	allows us to set a minimum size, which is itself contained
	in a GtkAlignment, so we may specific the widget has
	stretchable or not, among others. We could cut YGtkMinSize
	on most widgets by having that value passed by the YGWidget
	constructor, but too many arguments there would obviously
	not be very nice...

	So, this layout code has the advantages of: being simpler,
	faster and not suffering from the labels getting truncated
	problem. It also gives us let us do some hacks like, for
	instance, having labels and entries aligned horizontally...

	* YGLayout.h: removed.

	* ygtkratiobox.c: honor right-to-left languages. The API
	needs to be modified a bit in order to let it be possible
	to set a widget to be fully stretchable, independent from
	the weight. We need to fix this limitation for Layout-mixed.ycp
	test.

2006-11-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabel.cc: attempt at making YGColoredLabel
	working properly on KDE (for gtk-qt theme), by
	using expose, rather than putting the GtkLabel in
	a GtkEventBox. Unfortunately, it doesn't like
	filling rectangles with a frame (but I really liked
	the frame look, so I will just hope gtk-qt has fixed
	this). Either way, the code	is nicer this way.

	* ygtkmenubutton.c: use, either explicitely or
	implicitely, an aid widget to popup regular widgets.

2006-10-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: don't return failure if
	SetDialogIcon command fails - it breaks the installer.

	* HACKING: update to use gtkize-iso, removing 8 steps.

	* integrate/YaST2.call: do minimal hacks instead to
	get gtk bits running, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH too, appears
	to actually work [!]

	* gtkize-iso: s/cromfs/cramfs/ & include critical
	pango modules.

2006-10-26  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (hash_table_clear_cb, hash_table_clear) 
	(ygtk_wizard_clear_tree, ygtk_wizard_clear_steps): use
	g_hash_table_remove_all instead.
	(enable_widget): rename macros to upper-case, add _str
	variant that can handle NULL too (defensively)
	(ygtk_wizard_set_help_text): set m_help instead of
	the widget itself. (help_button_clicked_cb): set the
	help here if we show it.
	(ygtk_help_dialog_init): hide help widget on delete
	rather than destroying it & causing problems later.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc (YGPushButton): set can-default
	on all push-buttons, makes ok/cancel type dialogs
	prettier.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_destroy, destroy_hash):
	cope with double destroys.
	(ygtk_help_dialog_init): use pack_end, scope var decls,
	set CAN_DEFAULT on close button to get spacing right.
	(ygtk_wizard_realize): use gtk_wiget_get_ancestor instead
	of custom code, make static.
	(button_new): split out - and set CAN_DEFAULT.
	(destroy_string): use g_free instead.

2006-10-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* ygtkwizard.c: re-write of it and made it based on GtkBin
	rather than GtkEventBox. We now do all the container work
	in a similar way to GtkAssistant, so the two style changeable
	settings (content-padding and header-padding) should reflect
	in this "clone" of ours as well.
	Help information is displayed in a dialog, rather than on the
	usual box.

	* ygtksteps.c: re-write and made it based on GtkWidget rather
	than GtkVBox, steps being "hand" drawn by ourselves now, rather
	than being GtkLabels. This allows for a better integration with
	YGtkWizard.

	* made a couple of improvements to the other native GTK widgets
	of ours.

	NOTE: This is all unstable work and there are known crashes and
	bugs. But I would prefer to have this on svn because it is get-
	-ting to be a pretty big change... Should we open an unstable branch?
	Or just advice the packager to stick with some svn version?
	Either way, shouldn't be too hard to squish the bugs.

2006-10-09  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* integrate/*: add Ricardo's touched files

	* gtkize-iso: 1st pass at a tool to 'gtk'ize an
	existing install ISO.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_init): add 'tt' -> monospace.

2006-10-09  Thomas Meeks  <thomas@imaginator.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (doSetSize): don't set request < -1 ever,
	prunes warning.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_init): add spacer & re-arrange
	padding to improve bottom button box spacing.

2006-09-27  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: cleanups; decided not to make use of signals for
	YGWindow.
	* src/YGDialog.cc & YGUI.cc: added support for --geometry, --fullscreen,
	--noborder and --nowm.

2006-09-23  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h and others: disabled the debugging printing by default.
	Uncomment #define IMPL_DEBUG on YGUI.h to enable it.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: handle more than one main window properly. The bug
	that was avoiding this commit was that a label with our own pango font
	description set wasn't returning a proper size request (and this may
	happen in other cases). Setting the father container in a GtkWindow,
	rather than doing that only on showWindow() seemed to solve the issue.
	I wonder if there is a more elegant way to fix this and why it needs a
	GtkWindow as the base of the hierarchy to work...

	TO do: abstract YGWindow further. We will have to make it a GObject to
	use its signal system. And support --geometry & friends.

	TO fix: I would like to catch the escape key to send a Cancel event to
	YWidgets for popup dialogs. Somehow that doesn't seem to work -- check
	key_pressed_cb().

2006-09-19  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: bug fix: show default tab at start, and got rid of
	warnings.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: show disk usage warning when it starts getting
	full.

2006-09-15  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: some love to it: only set paragraph spacing for p, h1 and
	alike, fixed html not rendering on tools like the printer, added center and
	img tag.

2006-09-12  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGComboBox.cc, YGTable.cc: it seems that YSelectionWidget.h supports
	icons... Qt only honors them for SelectionBox, but I added support for the
	rest of the YSelectionWidget children classes as well (that is, ComboBox and
	MultiSelectionBox). Checkout the tests.

	* src/YGTable.cc: bug fix: mismatch of YCP row numbering and GtkListStore that
	was causing some glitches. Now, we use a double hash to translate between them.

	* src/YGUI.cc: busy cursor should now be set properly when a YCP program is
	doing work for some time, like Qt. UI::BusyCursor() and UI::NormalCursor()
	seem to be now obsolet methods with this approach.
	Added YGUI::beep(), currently disabled, to go with the core patch.

	* ycc.sh: re-worked a bit: pass z for examples and x for our tests. qt to also
	run the Qt frontend.

2006-09-11  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: patterns chosen should now get reflected
	on the packages list. Some minor upgrades to the interface as well.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added installation/removal of languages
	to the patterns dialog.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: improved accuracy of the dependencies list
	on confirmation dialog a lot.

2006-09-10  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added support for upgrades (fine grading
	on right click).

2006-08-23  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: don't show available packages that are
	already installed, unless the version is different where it should
	display its version. Updating a package with a newer version is not
	yet supported which is kinda of nasty.
	(not really hard to add, but will have to wait.)

	* YGPackageSelector.cc: patch selector: don't show installed packages
	and do the job properly.

2006-08-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c: remove bogus utils.h include.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): bin yast2.txt

2006-08-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_init): move link_color
	upwards, so the constructor can set it up.

2006-08-22  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: quick fix for the unsupported "one main dialog
	to rule them all" functionality that yast requires.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc , src/YGTable.cc & src/YGTree.cc: added
	g_object_unref() for all models. I thought GtkTreeView would assume
	ownership, but it just refs them. So, even if after
	gtk_tree_view_set_model() we need to unref them.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: show software dependencies and requirments
	on summary window.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: search implemented.

	* src/YGImage.cc: bugfix: image was getting cut due to not
	honoring borders on drawing.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed problem solver.

	* src/YGTable.cc, src/YGPackageSelector.cc and YGUtils.cc: set columns
	sortable on the patch selector, and set it sorted on severity by default.
	(GTK is nothing trivial on this respect, but it gives us a lot of power,
	 so we can sort by severity not by string. I mean, the severity string
	 doesn't necessarly mean the least severe to the most severe...)

2006-08-21  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YWidget.cc: fixed menomnic on scrolled widget and hide label
	when passing empty string, as agreed with Stefan.

	* src/ygtkwidget.c & src/YGTree.cc: fixed that oldie bug of autoyast
	flickering. It turns out my sucpitions about overlapping widgets
	were (hopefully!) wrong. It was easier to debug now that we have a
	YGWizard. The reason of the bug was that we were sending an event when
	the user selected a tree branch and when the YCP asked a branch to
	be selected. The last cause shouldn't happen and causes a cycle (in
	certain YCP applications), which hogs up the CPU at full usage, thus
	the flicker. Amusing enough I repeated the bug on the YGWidget's tree
	implementation. :P I noticed that YGTable also had the same issue :/ (fixed).
	Lesson learned. :)
	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed mentioned bug and a crash on the sorting mechanism
	when clearing rows (like in Table3.ycp example).

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: functional version (just misses
	search and some other glitches yet to fix for basic functionality
	be done -- I have also not tested it much, so...).It features a patch,
	pattern and package selectors. These last both are somewhat integrated.
	It shows a summary dialog (it doesn't yet list dependencies --
	actually, I am don't think those are dealt with, maybe with conflicts
	dialog) and a conflicts dialog. License signing dialog (that some
	packages force) should be working except that there is some mismatch
	between the headers and libraries Zypp versions here on that point
	(the function is there and it compiles fine without warnings, but the
	linker complains), so it is disabled.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c/h: added this base widget for YGWizard and
	YGPackageSelector.

	* HACKING: some Zypp info.

2006-08-08  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: some border fixings.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: tag sizes in proportion to normal font.
	* src/YGWizard.cc: set icon.
	* src/YGDialog.cc: and use it on children dialogs.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: initial code (I am just trying to
	see if I can even print a list of packages with Zypp! :/)

2006-08-03  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLayout.h: don't overload macro operators. This
	should fix macro playing.

2006-08-01  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUI.cc: implemented:
	+ screenshot - Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S

	+ macros - use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M (to start & stop)
	           then Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P (play)
	(not yet working -- looks like we have to do some trick with
	 the events handling to let them pass? Michael, maybe you could
	 check playMacro() on YGUI.cc and respective Qt.)

	+ busy/normal cursor.
	+ some fixes on the file dialogs.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: added <big>, <small>, <br> and
	set used cursor_new_for_display().

2006-07-31  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: improved layout spacing a bit.
	(to be worked out: some small wizard layout issues.)

	* src/YGLabel.cc: work out output label field to look
	non-editable.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc: use stock icons.

2006-07-30  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: added sortable table support.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: fixed container border.

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc: added support for borders
	and min sizes.

2006-07-29  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: simple fix for a crash on tags that
	are not closed (ie. on EOF).

2006-07-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (idleLoop, YGUI, checkInit): do gtk_init
	idly, inside the thread in which we run the gtk+
	mainloop to avoid CORBA confusion with a11y.

2006-07-28 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: setSize() and niceSize() should give
	good values (though things are not yet shining)

	* src/YGDialog.cc: warn/info-dialog option now shows an icon
	at the left rather than a background color.

	* src/YGWidget.cc: set-ed a frameborder  on GtkScrolledWindow,
	which I just noticed that is supported. I was actually putting the
	GtkScrolledWindow inside a GtkFrame on YGWizard... :P (fixed)

2006-07-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (defaultSize): fix default sizing logic.

	* src/YGWizard.cc (YGWizard): use gtk_box_pack_start
	and fix a number of layout issues.

	* src/*.c: remove all g_list_first macros: implicit.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c (ygtk_ratio_box_init): clean.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CXXFLAGS): set THEMEDIR.
	* src/YGWizard.cc (class YGWizard): use THEMEDIR

	* src/ygtkbargraph.c (ygtk_bar_graph_setup_entry): add
	Tango palette from Jimmac for graphs, order it to get a
	pleasant set of colors first.
	(ygtk_bar_graph_new): use a void prototype

	* src/YGDialog.cc ::YGDialog: remove bogus
	g_object_set causing warning.
	(configure_event_cb): don't setSize if we just moved.

	* TODO: prune tons of cruft.

	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst):
	fix br handling to to clobber 'b' tags.
	
	* src/YGUtils.cc (emit_unclosed_tags_for, tag_entry_new) 
	(tag_entry_free, check_early_close) 
	(ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): complicate royally,
	now handles all the new tests in

	* src/test.cc (testXHtmlConvert): here: cope with unclosed
	<p> and <li>, and generic, un-closed tags.

2006-07-28 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGFrame.cc: follow Gnome HIG (no border, bold label
	and some children identation).

	* src/YGWizard.cc: check for pane movements correctly.

2006-07-27 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c/h: added this button widget that
	displays a popup when pressed. The popup doesn't have to
	be necessarly of type GtkMenu that it does the work to
	make the thing pop-able.
	* src/YGMenuButton.cc / YGDate: use above.
	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c/h: added this entry that supports
	more than one field (from Baruch Even).
	* src/ygtkspinbox.c/h: replaced by above.

	* src/YGWizard.cc: added pane (there doesn't seem to be a
	way other than connecting its children to size-allocate to
	get pane movements... So this currently does unnecessary work
	on window resizing which is undesirable cause its slow).
	* src/YGWizard.cc: set help box by number of chars in a line,
	not pixels, as suggested by Michael.

2006-07-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): 
	re-work to cope with hr & br tags, add <body> tag if
	no outer tag.
	
	* src/test.cc (testXHtmlConvert): add torture
	tests.

	* src/YGUtils.cc (mapKBAccel): add _ escaping.
	(ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): split to here.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_set_text): upd.

	* src/YGUtils.h (YGUtils): add missing dependant
	headers & guards.

	* src/test.cc: simple automated test set for
	'make check', (testMapKBAccel): impl.

	* AUTHORS: set the record straight.

2006-07-26 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkspinbox.h/c: An extension over GtkSpinButton that
	adds support for more than one field.
	* src/YGTime.cc: implemented YGTime and YGDate.

2006-07-23 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: regression to Michael's code
	(with a couple of fixes) due to instability.

2006-07-18 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: changed look and added sanity checks
	to commands.
	* src/YGAlignment.cc: background image supported.
	* src/YGImage.cc: done.
	* src/ygtksteps.c: added alias steps support and made it
	non-expansible.
	* src/ygtkbargraph.cc: changed mask to fixed colors and chosen
	some.
	* src/YGPartitionSplitter.cc: should be fully operational.
	* src/YGComboBox.cc: implemented maxchars and validchars.
	* src/YGMenuButton.cc: bug fix: popup menu right on button press.
	* src/ygtk_ratio_box.h/c: YGtkRatioBox is now abstract, being instanced
	by *HBox and *VBox. (still using a common size_request/allocate.)
	* src/YGMultiProgressMeter.cc: bug fix: vertical orientation fixed.
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: bug fix: radio buttons behaving too much like
	a toggle button.

2006-07-09 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: first try.

2006-07-07 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: getFixed() can now be overloaded
	and thise
	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: first try.

2006-07-06 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkbargraph.c: moved BarGraph to a Gtk class.
	* src/ygtkslider.c: a more complex gtkscale.
	* src/YGBarGraph.cc: added YGPartitionSplitter.

2006-07-05 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ratiobox.cc renamed to src/ygtkratiobox.cc
	* src/YGMultiProgressMeter.cc: new widget.
	* src/YGProgressBar.cc: added YGDownloadProgress.
	* src/YGBarGraph.cc: first try at writting a Gtk
	class out of it for usage in PartitionSplitter.
	It's broken though. Maybe Michael has a clue on
	the error...

2006-07-04 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ratiobox.cc: changed size request so that the
	container always has space for the smallest widget.
	Fixed some left space caused by precision losses.
	* YGBarGraph.cc: fixed label text.

2006-07-03 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc src/ratiobox.cc: added ratio
	container and made bar graph making use of it.
	Still some issues to care.

2006-06-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.cc (class YGGenericLabel): use
	m_inner_widget not m_widget to avoid confusion.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (YGDialog): if opt.hasDefaultSize
	set modal & type hint to dialog; set 'allow_shrink'
	to allow windows to be shrunk.
	(configure_event_cb): listen for configure event,
	use it instead of (size_allocate) nastiness.
	(setSize): get/set defaultSize not size request.

	* src/YGUI.cc (defaultSize): 1st cut.
	(YGUI): parse arguments etc.

	* src/Y2CCGtk.cc: re-indent.

	* src/YGFrame.cc (setSize, nicesize, childAdded):
	bin bogus size calculation for children.

2006-06-24  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* BUGS: added this file that could be used as a notebook
	for issues, so we don't loose track of them. Nothing
	comprehensive or anything...

2006-06-21  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGMenuButton.cc: added support for YMenuButton.

2006-06-19  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (construct): ref/sink the widget
	(~YGWidget): destroy / unref widget when freed.

	* src/YGUI.cc/.h: move boolean flag impls to here
	from the header, beautify header, move cursor
	bits to .cc.

2006-06-17  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGIntField.cc: added YSlider support.

	* src/YGLabel.cc: added YColoredLabel support.

2006-06-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h: added info/warn color.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: cleanups as asked by Michael.

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: added YLogView support.

2006-06-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h: don't close the window when the user
	presses the window manager close button. Instead report
	it to Yast.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: sub-bullets and numbering should
	be working, as well as sub-"blockquotes".
	And added the link color code suggested by Michael.

2006-06-16  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRichText.cc (rt_end_element): remove debug.
	(setText): fix auto scroll down - we need to use
	gtk_text_view_scroll_to_mark - which queues the scroll
	until mapped/sized etc.

2006-06-15  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h: added the emitEvent() method.
	Also did some others of Michael's suggestions.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: added basic bullets.

2006-06-14  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGRichText.cc: added support for hyperlinks.
	I have changed some code ordering (can put it back
	if you don't like...), but the rendering should be
	unchaged. Hyperlink code was adapted from the gtk-demos.

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: changed a couple of things
	that could have been done easier.

	* src/YGImage: initial image support (misses
	tiled and scale-to-fit)

2006-06-13  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTree.cc: changed the attribution of an
	absolute path of GtkTreePath to each YTreeItem,
	that would have to be freed, by the attribute of
	just an index. The path can easily be calculated.
	This should also make it easier if we want that
	setCurrentItem() searches and builds the path
	itself.

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed a memory leak.

2006-06-09  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTableView.cc (YGMultiSelectionBox):
	should now be working properly.
	The allignment from the YGTable should be fixed
	as well.

	+ addRow() returns the position of the added row
	because sometimes it might not be possible
	to insert it at the intended position.
	This makes MultiSelectionBox example from the
	Yast manual working.

	+ added a getYWidget() to YGWidget so that we
	can make some magic on toggled_cb to avoid
	the previous approach of having a structure
	of pointers (we need to pass YGTableView and
	YMultiSelectionBox...).

2006-06-08  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUtils: function that converts integers
	to strings gets to see the light at the end of
	the tunnel as it is not used.

2006-06-08  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	Made some changes suggested by Michael, mainly the
	move of YGLabeledWidget and YGScrolledWidget to the
	same file of YGWidget.

	* src/YGTree: added set/getCurrentItem() using
	Michael's suggestions. It saves the YTree items
	on a non-visible column for getCurrentItem().
	And it uses data()/setData() from YTreeItems to
	save the GtkTreePath there and retrive it on
	getCurrentItem(). Pretty elegant -- and all examples
	run nicely.

2006-06-08  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc (setInputMaxLength): remove
	bogus pThis usage.

2006-06-07  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTable.cc (itemAdded): fix crash.

2006-06-06 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: implemented the YMultiLineEdit.
	* src/YGScrolledWidget.h/cc: added this new convinience parent
	widget. It is being used by YGMultiLineEdit, YGRichText,
	YGTree and YGTableView derivates.

2006-06-06 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: worked over the YGTableView API and
	made YGSelectBox and YGMultiSelectBox using it.
	(Note: YGTable is segfaulting and toggle buttons on
	 Multi* don't seem to like "activatable" attribute.)

	* src/YGTree.cc: tree now goes inside a GtkScrolledWindow
	which gives it the needed scroll bars.

	* src/YGUI.h: added dialogs to open directories and files.

2006-06-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTable.cc (class YGTable): inherit 1st from
	YTable, and 2nd from YGTableView, so constructors
	get invoked in the right order, and so the
	setWidgetRep works as expected.

2006-06-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* README: simplify list of what works with
	wildcards: helps highlight slightly incomplete bits.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: Improve signal connection /
	blockage, fix whitespace.
	(class YGCheckBox): impl.

2006-06-04 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabel.cc: worked out; all examples now work.
	* src/YGLabeledWidget.cc: added support for buddies.
	(Notes: YGUtils::setLabel() was removed as it is
	 not needed.)

	* src/YGTree.cc: First implementation
	(misses get/setCurrentItem())

2006-06-03 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: added table support; all
	examples work. But two things still need attention:
	+ I'm not sure what the first letter on the headers
	is supposed to do.
	+ Signal for when the user selects an item isn't
	being sent.
	(unfortunately, inetd or users yast modules aren't
	working near well. But it seems like layout issues.)

2006-06-02  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGReplacePoint.cc, src/YGAlignment.cc,
	* src/YGLayout.cc: merge into YGLayout. Implement
	YSquash as well.
	
	* src/YGSplit.cc, src/YGEmpty.cc, src/YGSpacing.cc,
	* src/YGLayout.cc: merge into YGLayout.

	* src/Makefile.am: update.

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc is now src/YGLabeledWidget.cc

2006-06-02  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.cc (setLabel): add missing chain to parent,
	clean some cruft.

	* ycc.sh: re-work to use the gtk+ option: zenity :-)

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: constructor now is an independent
	woman. This was possible because of gtk_combo_box_set_model().
	setValue() should work, but it's a hack.

2006-06-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTextEntry.cc (YGTextEntry): use SET_LABEL_CHAIN

	* src/YGComboBox.cc (getComboBox): impl. & use, fix
	whitespace issues, use SET_LABEL_CHAIN

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc (YGLabelWidget): inline (construct),
	set use_underline on the label, fix some whitespace bits.
	Add YGLABEL_WIDGET_IMPL_SET_LABEL_CHAIN.
	(doSetLabel): rename from setLabel.

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc/hh: added this convinience
	class that displays a label next to the intended
	widget.

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: workable combo box.
	To do: implement setValue() -- seems far from trivial.
	And add validChars filter -- easy after setValue() done.
	* src/YGTextEntry.cc: fully implemented text entry.
	(Note: I haven't implemented *MultipleChanges() as 
	I think the overhead of it on a single entry text
	widget should not worth it. Qt does the same.)

	* src/YGUtils.cc/hh: added these couple files
	that should have functions shared between classes
	or that just make sense to be in such a file.
	Currently has setLabel() and is_str_valid().
	(Note: setLabel() doesn't yet support buddies.)

	* src/YGWidget.h: added keyboard focus macro.

2006-05-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc: remove createComboBox

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: move it here, implement a noddy
	skeleton.

2006-05-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc (setValue): block signals to
	avoid supurious events: fixes RadioButton1
	
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc (getCheckRadioButtonType):
	remove bus-load of debug, angst & crud. Kill elusive
	crasher (gdb was lying), sub-class GtkRadioButton to
	make behavior more Qt-like.

2006-05-27  Michael Meeks  <michael@>

	* src/YGSelectionBox.cc: add - stub for timezone
	selector. YGSquash.cc needed next: should be simple -
	go Ricardo go ! ;-)

	* src/Makefile.am (libpy2gtk_la_SOURCES): add
	YGSelectionBox.cc

	* src/YGWidget.cc: tag YGWIDGET_DUFF_LAYOUT & remove
	the crufty guff trying to fixup some issues.
	(clobbered_size_allocate, dynamic_subtype, moveWidget):
	remove.

	* test.sh: helpful script for testing.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (YGDialog): remove set_default_size
	causing grief.

	* src/YGSplit.cc (class YGSplit): use new
	SET_SIZE_CHAIN - all 'Fixed' containers should do
	this.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (setSize): remove horrible hack
	to trap set_size_request -> size_allocate -> ~ loop,
	much cleaner now.

2006-05-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* configure.in: use PKG_CHECK_MODULES, fixes odd
	64bit problem.

	* autogen.sh: pass --libdir inferred from
	yast2-devtools libdir: fixes 64bit foo; don't set
	the wrong PKG_CONFIG_PATH unless we have nothing to
	go on.

2006-05-25  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* README, yast2.txt: update & clarify.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getNiceSize): remove ugly
	hack, and emit 'size_request' signal ourselves 
	to avoid need for hack.

2006-05-25  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* commit to Novell forge CVS: thanks kobliha

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getNiceSize): remove ugly
	hack, and emit 'size_request' signal ourselves 
	to avoid need for hack.

2006-05-17  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc: fix setSize

	* src/YGWidget.cc: revert to old-style layout
	again, forgotten the (good?) reasons for the pain.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (YGWidget): if (!show) - toplevel
	window: don't much about with 'size_allocate'
	sub-classing: fixes window sizing issues.

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (doMoveChild): impl. as a method.
	(do_size_allocate): factor out of (doSetSize).
	(doMoveChild): act on the child's allocation not ours.
	Works rather nicely (now).

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (clobbered_size_allocate): impl.
	(doSetSize): impl. add CLOBBER_SIZE_ALLOCATE control,
	default to off. Just need some more work on custom
	GtkAllocation manipulation by containers.

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (YGWidget): add 'hack here'
	goodness.
	(dynamic_subtype): create dynamic sub-type & clobber
	size_allocate.
	(clobbered_size_allocate): this needs to be able
	to filter out individual widgets [ via g_object_data ? ]
	to allow individual size allocations to be performed
	without the rest of the children getting them too.

	* src/YGWidget.[ch]: re-factor constructor to take
	'type' & construction time args; this will allow a
	dynamic sub-classing to happen there to allow
	clobbering of size_request/allocate [etc.]
	* src/*: update to fit.
	* src/YGImage.c: clobber for now.

2006-04-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc, src/YGImage.cc: add
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: add - something badly
	wrong with destruction logic though.

2006-04-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: fold YGDialog.h in.

	* src/YGUI.cc: impl. get screen dimensions /
	default size etc.

2006-04-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (idleLoop): set NULL encoding.

	* src/YGRichText.cc (YGRichText): impl.

2006-04-04  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPushButton.cc, src/YGUI.cc: move.

2006-04-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRichText.cc: stubbed.

2006-03-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (YGUI): call 'topmostConstructorHasFinished'
	(idleLoop, ycp_wakeup_fn): deal with fd_ycp properly.

2006-03-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.h, src/YGSplit.h: remove.

	* src/YGTextEntry.cc: partial impl.

	* src/YGSpacing.cc, src/YGReplacePoint.cc,
	* src/YGProgressBar.cc, src/YGEmpty.cc: impl.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (show): impl.

2006-03-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* configure.in: catch non /usr prefixes.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getFixed): walk up widget hierarchy
	first looking for 'Fixed's.

	* src/YGSplit.cc (YGSplit): also a GtkFixed - we need
	a nested hierarchy of Fixed it seems.

2006-03-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.h (ui): fix silly infinite recursion,
	click the button to exit now works.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (nicesize): fix sizing.

2006-03-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGSplit.h: remove bogus niceSize impl causing
	difficulties.

	* src/YGUI.cc (dumpWidgetTree, dumpYastTree): expose.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (nicesize): remove hack /crop to
	max 50 pixels large.

	* src/YGWidget.h (getWidgetName): return better names.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (setSize, ygdialog_size_allocate):
	make dynamic sizing work better (can grow at least)

	* yast2.txt: helpful devel. pointers.

	* configure.in, src/*: add some code.

	* Import personal play-ground of no real value.

	* Please feal extremely free to commit
	  tasteful bug fixes
