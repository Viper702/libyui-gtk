2009-02-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

2009-01-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

2009-01-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGDownloadProgress): bug fix 460106:

2009-01-19  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector (PackageSelector): a couple of mockups

2008-12-23  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: revert scroll_to_cell parameters.

2008-12-22  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc, touching most code: some small cleanups on
	macros and connections.

	* src/YGTable.cc (YGTable): disable sorting by default. Improved
	setSortable (false): changing states still not functioning completely.

2008-12-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h, src/YGLayoutBox.cc, src/YGDialog.h, src/YGFrame.cc,
	  src/YGDumbTab.cc, src/YGRadioButton.cc, src/YGWizard.cc:
	  	bug fix 460728: make sure to call parent class for add and removeChild

2008-12-18  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGSelectionModel.h/cc: bug fix 459313: we are using GTK model
	and YItem tree will mirror each other, which breaks when sorting.
	Replace the algorithm: using a linear search for unique ids now.

	* src/YGTable.cc: sort 1st column by default, and replace the ugly
	"X" by an unicode check mark character.

2008-12-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPushButton.cc: test role for help icon.

2008-12-15  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed a bug from a commit at 12-12,
	causing online_update to be unfunctional.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: no need to show "applies to" in the details
	box when multiple patches are selected (see bug 459095).

2008-12-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 457563: enable Apply button

	around the code, keep a singleton point for it.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: fixed pattern categories ordering.

2008-12-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

2008-12-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* tests/Wizard2.ycp: try to add a test for 449773.

2008-12-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: arabic fix: margin was being mirrored for
	block tags like <li> and <blockquote>.

	* src/YGUI.cc: bug fix 442052: GTK doesn't seem to have a desktopSize()
	call that doesn't include the panel and window frame in the display-size.
	Assume less 80px in the display-size to compensate for that.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: maximize main window for small screens.

2008-12-01  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	icon fallback.

	size-group.

	* src/ygtkcellrenderertextpixbuf.c: clear Y-padding.

	* src/YGWidget.cc: bug fix 449385: add a colon at the end of a label: changed
	to an inclusive: instead of adding it to all cases other than ':' and '.'.
	Add it only in the cases where the last character is a letter.

2008-12-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	fix: #446064 - lots of code movement, regression tests and little
	underlying change:
	
	* src/test.cc (testHeaderize): impl. with some real regression tests.

	* src/YGWizard.cc (YGWidget): do product substitution here.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: move convert_to_xhtml into
	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhtml): here.
	(ygutils_headerize_help): convert to xhtml first.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_header_set_description): split out to:
	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_headerize_help): here.

2008-12-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (doSetLabel): cope with unicode colon too: 449385

2008-11-30  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: ensure header text is black to contrast with the
	white background (independent of style).

2008-11-28  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc (YPartitionSplitter): fix for arabic: tell GTK
	to not mirror the splitter since we want to keep the partition's order.

	* src/YGPackageSelector (ListView): fix for arabic: properly align packages
	names and descriptions to the right (otherwise, Pango tries to be smart
	when aligning English multi-line text for RTL).

	* src/YGUI.cc (glyph): fix for arabic: on yast initilization a right-arrow
	is used: make it use a left one for arabic.

	* src/ygtkcellrenderertextpixbuf.c: fix for arabic: made the alignment
	when an icon is set working properly. (bug fix 449627)

	* src/ygtkfixed.c: fix for arabic: mirror the UI for arabic. libyui probably
	should do this in the future.

	* src/ygtklinklabel.c: fix for arabic: header open help line's "more"
	link wasn't being placed properly.

	* src/ygtksteps.c: fix for arabic: mirror the marker placement.

	* src/YGSelectionModel.cc: fixed getMaxDepth() for lists.
	* src/YGComboBox.cc: when too many items, wrap the combo into columns.

	* src/YGTable.cc (YTable): when the last column alignment flag is set,
	append a shadow column because GTK doesn't support not having no
	expand columns.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: i18n fix: use g_utf8_collate in order to properly
	sort languages and PackageKit categories.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ListView): arabic fix: because of our previous
	hack, status column is now 1: adjust tooltips.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: arabic fix (bug fix 449600): GtkTextView only detects
	Arabic in a paragraph per paragraph basis. Work around it so the entire
	text, including the English parts, are aligned to the right.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: export setTitle() to C code.
	* src/ygtklinklabel.c: bug fix 449194: "more" link was disapearing on unmap.
	Not sure why but showing it on map was causing glitches.
	Just force a resize.
	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix 449194: update the window title on map (when the
	wizard is swapped in).

	* src/YGLayout.cc: bug fix 446524: disable those orphan icon buttons
	in the middle of a box.

	* src/YGLayout.cc, src/YGPushButton.cc & src/YGComboBox.cc: realize
	doesn't seem very reliable, so was using timeouts. Those can get
	trigger while the widget is destroyed though which can mean trouble.
	Use expose then disconnect. Also moved stock button stuff from
	YGLayout.cc to YGPushButton.cc.

2008-11-23  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: don't show "more" link on help line if the rest
	of the text is only markup.

2008-11-21  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGi18n.h: add __ macro for static string tagging
	* src/pkg-selector-help.h: tag our strings, mangle Christian's
	'Jager' to ascii to help (lame y2makepot) fixes 445950

2008-11-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix 446352: patches were not being shown.
	Code disabled from some debugging I guess, plus a fix to installed
	patches.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: honor patterns order.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Details): show contained packages from patch.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackagesView): set fixed height to
	pattern for performance reasons.

2008-11-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: use country suffix of language
	code for the flag, not the idiom prefix.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix: don't show grid mode for
	languages.

2008-11-14  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: bug fix 442052: clamp window to desktop size.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc & src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: show disk
	changed size.

	* src/ygtktimezone.c: bug fix 445158: crashing when timezone map
	is missing.

2008-11-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc & YG*.cc: bug fix 443214: bad event handling
	on YSlider. Took the chance to reforms things a bit: signals are
	now registered through YGWidget and a block method is offered that
	should be used when a widget changes some GTK property.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: bug fix: initialize to 0 the item select,
	rather than -1.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackagesView),
	src/ygtkzypperwrapper.h/cc & src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: show zypp
	icons and installed info for patterns.

	* src/ygtktooltip.h/c: hide widget from access; only expose a
	couple of presentation methods.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): show tooltip indicating
	file filter is only applicable to installed packages.

2008-11-09  Coolo  <coolo@suse.de>

	* Version 2.17.5

2008-11-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: don't call parent YWidget::setKeyboardFocus():
	that will only issue a "not implemented" warning.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: selecting the very first step wasn't working.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c & src/ygtksteps.h/c : if empty step id string
	passed, set no step selected.

2008-11-06  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: add a clear flag to query pool.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Collections::Pool): clear
	listing pool when no pattern or language is selected.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: made packageModified() working with every
	package type (than just the "package" type).

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: because of patterns, check if it's installed
	at start, because modifying the package might modify it's installed
	status.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: align icon next to label in status buttons.

2008-11-05  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc (YGPartitionSplitter): bug fix: bar graph
	value update wasn't quite synchronized.

	* src/YGLabel.cc: don't set selectable for labels that use just
	one break line for padding purposes.

	* src/YGUtils.h/cc: added touchAlpha flag to setOpacity() that makes
	the pixbuf whiter by the alpha layer.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: set pattern and languages tooltip icon
	transparent if not installed -- and use list icons if none provided.

2008-11-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix 441143: use candidate object as the
	newest version -- just looking at the numbers ignores the arch.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: moved &nbsp; to a generic entity lookup function.

2008-11-02  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc: got rid of ygtkprogressbar.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ListView): revert status tooltip for
	Language.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: enableRepoMgr flag not totally honored...

2008-10-28  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfindentry.h/c: added tooltip argument to insert_item.
	added set_state() method to highlight the entry for incorrect
	input, and select_item().

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: moved recent spin box into a find entry
	item. Also, only remove find entry when changing the type combo.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: zypp::RepoManager::knownRepositories() isn't
	accurate, but it features disabled repositories, so use it for that
	purpose.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: honor enableRepoMgr flag.

	* src/Makefile.am, src/YGPackageSelector.cc & src/ygtkzyppwrapper.cc:
	install quality PNG icons, instead of embeding XPM ones.

2008-10-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Categories): ensure Categories item
	visibility when the pane forces the list size to be reduced.

2008-10-24  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	(double-click or space) install the package.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (setMinSize): fixed height.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: added Package::support() and notifyMesage()
	interface in order to support ResObject::insnotify() and delnotify().

	notifyMessage().

	* src/yzypptags.h/cc: sync groups with yast2-qt.

2008-10-23  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix 436948: recommended & suggested in
	particular, but this may apply to groups as well, may not be all
	listed because we weren't checking for all selectable objects.
	(because of different packagers some may be more detailed...)

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 437738: clear the package details &
	controls when package un-selected.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix 436763 (in part): restrict the bottom buttons
	from the steps area to the contents area.
	Also, set bottom buttons width request to 0, since they adjust.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: worked description authors code a bit better;
	added support for "author:" and "authors:" sequential lines.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: was adding an extra double space
	on the description text for available packages.

2008-10-19  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkbargraph.h/cc: moved color customization out of setup routine.
	* src/YGBarGraph.cc (YGBarGraph): honor textColor().

	* src/ygtkratiobox.cc (used by YGtkBarGraph): was allocating the widget
	at the window position x=0.

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc (YGPartitionSplitter): bug fix: the widget was
	broken. Aligned labels correctly as well. #437738#

2008-10-18  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	setWidgetFont() utility.

	* src/YGLabel.cc: do italic for outputField. And set selectable for
	multi-line labels.

	* src/YGUI.cc: enhancement fix for bug 335492: the person found
	difficult to nagivate to / from the GTK file selector dialog.
	Adding / to the side pane, in case it's not there.

2008-10-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h: enable rich text tables for webkit.

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrap.c: replace it's popup which has entries like "go back" and
	"reload" for one with only "copy" and "select all".

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: use YGtkRichText for descriptions. WebKit
	doesn't implement size_request and hacking it through seems futile. We'll
	have to patch it up if we want that in the future.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/.cc: added "rich" argument to requires() and provides(),
	in order to escape html characters, responsible for the small size of those
	lists ;) (they were being truncated).

	* configure.in.in: it seems there are both the "WebKitGtk" and "webkit-1.0"
	from OSS and Gnome-Community repos. Check for both.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c & src/YGUtils.h/.cc: moved setOpacity() to YGUtils.

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrap.h/.c: added support for background image to WebKit.
	(there is no opacity in CSS, so I just placed the img in the side...)
	Improved CSS style a bit as well.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: new image isn't truncated, so place it in the
	border as well.

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrap.c: fixed label:/ treatment.

	* src/YGUtils.h/cc & src/ygtkrichtext.h/c: moved convert_to_xhmtl
	from YGUtils to YGtkRichText.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: made scrollWidget with GtkAdjustment more robust
	and got rid of the GtkTextView specific.

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrap.c: fixed link click, injected some nicer CSS to text,
	implemented scroll.

2008-10-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.17.3

2008-10-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhtml): re-work the
	lower-casing, so we don't lower-case attribute values
	* src/test.cc (testXHtmlConvert): add test, and make
	regression tests pass again.

2008-10-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/c & src/YGWidget.h/cc: ask for widgets
	their minimum size while running (so we can query properties like
	stretchable()).

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc, YGDumbTab.cc, YGInputField.cc, YGIntField.cc,
	YGProgressBar.cc, YGTable.cc, YGText.cc: changed as a result;
	used values from yast2-qt.

	first about the user selected ones, then the autos (dependencies).

2008-10-09  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: version 5.13.1 already deprecated

	to inside their respective use_html_engine condition.

	* src/ygtksteps.h/.c: added get_nth_label() method.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: using the previous method, don't add
	repeated steps -- use those ids only for internal purposes.

2008-10-08  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* configure.in.in, src/Makefile.am: massage the webkit /
	gtkhtml pieces, add configure flag and AM conditionals etc.

	* src/linklabel.c: hide in effect if text empty.

2008-10-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

2008-10-02  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix 428193: idem.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: for bug 428965, set instead a higher default
	height. Already has big as qt: ycp progs should cope.

	* src/YGSelectionModel.h/cc: added method to calculate a tree's depth.

	* src/YGTable.cc: bug fix 428966: set tree lines only for big trees
	(higher than 4 in depth, and 100 in rows).

2008-09-30  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkbargraph.h/.c: replaced usage of deprecated GtkTooltips API
	by GtkTooltip.

	* src/ygtktooltip.h/.c: added YGtkTooltip widget that, unlike GtkTooltip,
	can be used more liberally.

	a stricter full_word_match parameter to the name query.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: compromise for bug 428162: show a tooltip
	telling the user there is a pattern available for the keyword he is
	looking for once, and depending on the current view.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: also, set a tooltip for the type combo box.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: bug fix 388172: looks like gtk xhtml processor is case
	sensitive.

2008-09-23  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	for a destroyed widget due to memory overwrite.

2008-09-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGText.cc: set MultiLineEdit wrap mode as WORD_CHAR.

	* src/YGTable.cc: wrt last commit, re-use function.

2008-09-15  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: only enable spy code for recent libyuis.

	* src/YGTable.cc: expand tree's row when selected, like Qt and as
	done by FileRoller. Feels much nicer.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc: only enable role code for recent libyuis.
	Also moved helpButton support to set icon code.

2008-09-11  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h/cc: added support for YDialog::highlight() which
	coupled with the new Spy debugger allows one to nicely travel through
	the widgets tree. (checkout with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Y)

	* src/YGUI.cc: coupled dumpGtk and dumpYast trees into the same
	dialog. (ctrl+alt+shift+T) Will eventually be obsolete by the new spy
	tool.

2008-09-11  jsrain

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed a typo.

	Make it align to the left.

	* src/YGLayout.cc: digress last change. Stefan is doing that in libyui now.

	* Version 2.17.0

2008-09-09  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed Pattern installed status.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: got rid of patterns remove button.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: bug fix: not syncing icon properly when entry
	text was deleted by instruction as an insert is triggered.

	* src/YGUI.cc: redirect GTK log messages to libyui system.
	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: enable html parsing warnings that go to libyui.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed repositories query (related to bug 418781).
	Was using some duplicated zypp API that is dysfunctional it seems.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: escaping the URL as some characters (like &)
	were confusing the Pango parser. Use the FILE stock icon for the ISO.

2008-09-08  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.18

2008-09-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: fixed tab shortcuts.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: set border.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: use the proper image API so the help icon gets
	aligned next to the label.

2008-08-29  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGLayout.cc: implemented new libyui widget YButtonBox, making
	buttons order comply with Gnome's guideline.
	Also made sure all buttons in a hbox have the same height as some may
	have an icon.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: added filelist and authors filter options, also
	improving the overall support.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added search options: file list and authors.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 418896: when filtering a repository,
	the most appropriate version wasn't the one selected.

	* src/test.cc: added tests for the purpose.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: replaced the old button icon approach based on English
	strings by one that tests button labels to stock ones.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 418781: it can happen that zypp doesn't
	have information on a package repository and we end up with a null pointer.
	This happens for the (new?) add-on tool, for the added repository.

2008-08-22  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzypptags.cc: bug request 418676: use title capitalization for

2008-08-18  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkcellrenderertextpixbuf.h/c: bug fix 416544: we must add the
	ATK hooks so the screen reader does its job. Just made it derive from
	GtkCellRendererText.

2008-08-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtklinklabel.c: small cosmetic fix.

2008-08-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: convert_to_xhtml() bug fix: allow '=' to be used
	inside quoted tag arguments.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: show bugzilla entries in patch description.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: don't show satisfied candidates if the package
	is not installed. And don't show broken installed packages if there is

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: translate patch severities.

	* src/YGUtils.cc & src/ygtkrichtext.c: fixed some glitches left from
	bug 396692, and fixed bug 404817 glitch.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: added support for the "hr" tag. Image at src/hr.xpm

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed random crash on the "printer" tool. Looks like
	it was Introduced when added the multiSelection flag.
	GtkTreeSelection::changed signal works funny; use GtkTreeView::cursor_changed.

	* src/YGTable.cc: looks like yast2-qt sends two signals when a combo box
	item is selected. Replicate the behavior as the printer tool depends on it.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: we set radio and check buttons horizontally stretchable
	to fill all the area, for cosmetic reasons. Don't do it when inside an horizontal
	box as it messes the layout.

2008-07-31  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: online update was broken.
	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: only show relevant patches.

	end.

	* src/ygtkhandlebox.h/.c: new widget: extends GtkHandleBox, supporting
	resizing of the deatached window.

	* src/YGUtils.h/.cc: got rid of splitString(). Replaced its usage by
	g_strsplit().

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: bug fix 411890: it looks like tabs can now have
	shortcuts: honor them.

2008-07-21  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.17
	
	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: Don't include removed header

	Honor flag for last column.

2008-07-17  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: got rid of the size calculation cache. Should fix
	some issues when using replace points.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: let the wrapper do an initial check on
	changes. Should fix bug 400635.

2008-07-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: implemented YTable's multiSelection flag.

	labels shortcuts.

2008-07-13  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: aesthetic fix: remove the space for the expanders
	if the side navegation bar is a plain list, as is the case for the
	firewall tool.

2008-06-30  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzypptags.cc: tweaked some icons as suggested by bug report
	404818.

2008-06-27  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 404382: was using always the label
	"upgrade" whether the changes were re-installs or downgrades.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: reporter 399256 asked for some keyboard
	mnemonics: added a couple for the install / remove buttons

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: consider a pattern or a patch installed
	or not using isSatisfied() like yast2-qt. Also made initial patterns
	loading faster. And removed some checks on patches that were causing them
	not to be displayed (bug 402855).

2008-06-25  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrap.h/c: got rid of set_background and fixed a crash
	if libgtkthml is used when an image can't be open.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: added a background for <pre>.

2008-06-24  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: forgot to make some strings on the changes
	bar translatable.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: when scrolling, we want to change the cursor
	if it is now on top of a link... There is no straight forward hook
	for scrolling -- used expose.

2008-06-22  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.16

2008-06-22  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 401767: popup menu install entry
	was using the remove icon, while the remove entry was using the install
	icon.

2008-06-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: made it actually sort the columns on
	"setKeepSorting (false)". We probably should do this by default
	but GTK isn't that nice at that.

	* src/YGTextView.cc (YGLogView) & src/ygtkrichtext.c: set ordinary
	cursor for these widgets as they are not editable.

2008-06-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: made radio and check buttons horizontally
	stretchable. (so that users can click on them in the empty space
	at their right, as usual in GTK UIs).

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix 402262: "/usr/bin/y2tool check-textdomain"
	error when packaging.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix 402316: looks like we should run the
	dependency solver at the startup.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: use "gnome-open" instead of "nautilus"
	directly for files and made the website link clickable as well
	(though libzypp Package::url() seems broken at the moment; always
	returning empty strings.)

2008-06-20  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.15

2008-06-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	window.

2008-06-19  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: bug fix 401835: if radio buttons weren't set
	in a radio group, then they'd crash when clicked (nobody actually does
	this, not really an issue.)

2008-06-18  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGLayout.cc: bug fix 401228: "Children widgets aren't disabled in
	Gtk UI".

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix 399465: "for some package show

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added separator on the side pane, for
	the recommended/suggested entries.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: make sure changes pane is built for summary
	mode (could be related to bug 399795).

2008-06-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtktimezonepicker.c: oops, g_strstrip doesn't want to be freed.

2008-06-09  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: bug fix 396692: glitches with breaklines
	and spaces around inline tags.

	internal.

2008-06-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	Filtered Repositories Dependencies dialog.

	* src/ygtktimezonepicker.h/c & YGInputField.cc: enhance fix 391729:
	implemented YTimezoneSelector.

2008-06-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c: fixed bug 396731: popup menu from the button
	up when near the bottom corner.

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed bug 396360 (more like a design flaw in libyui):
	"last column in Table widget is too far right with option right".
	Just ignoring the alignment for the last column, so it aligns left...

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed setKeepSorting(). Wasn't honoring when it
	was set false.

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: fixed bug: 396033. Some minor bug resulted from
	the fact we are supposed to call parent's methods before running
	our code... NOTE

	* src/YGDialog.cc: some changes to see if we fix bug 393143...

2008-06-02  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (YGApplication::makeScreenShot),
	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_help_dialog_init),
	* src/ygtkwizard.c (sync_window_title): tag more missing
	strings for translation in the next version bug #395803#

2008-06-02  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc & src/YGLayout.h/cc: now using libyui for
	the layout to avoid bugs and stuff. It's inter-laced with GTK,
	so we can keep our simplified containers like the dumbtab.

	* src/ygtkfixed.h/.c: added this container that makes life easier
	for YGLayoutBox and others.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/.c: simplified it.

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: fixed bug 394309: GTK returning null for
	active text.

	give a better look.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: let the side pane shrink.

	* src/YGUI.cc: fixed bug 395484. Wrong check that assumed error
	was set, crashing...

2008-05-28  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: bug fix: seems like we shouldn't unref the
	cursor -- GdkWindow will do that for us. This was crashing
	for bug 393143...

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: some hacks to add a second categories tree
	for the yast-qt groups.
	* src/yzypptags.h/cc: copied yast-qt categories treatment.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added Groups option to type combo.

2008-05-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTextView.cc, src/YGUI.cc & src/ygtkwizard.c: changed
	gdk_beep() to the new GTK gtk_widget_error_bell() call. This one
	will use the visual bell if setup at the "Sound" module from the
	Gnome control center.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: don't re-use the cursor -- possible fix for
	bug 393143?

2008-05-23  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector (PackageControl): regresses to the old
	buttons code until r47296. This aligns them vertically: wether
	we want to align them horizontally or not, it's better we use
	again this tested code...
	Something interesting would be to compact the versions if the
	pane area was small... Recurring to a notebook or expanders that
	contract...
	I guess we could also consider putting all the versions on the
	combo, with the default selected on depending on the view: if
	available, select some to upgrade. If install, selected installed...
	The installed could have both Remove and Replace buttons I guess,
	to avoid duplicating the entry...

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix 385710: keep wizard and window title
	sync-ed as wizard widgets can be added and removed at any point...

	* src/YGPackageSelector (ChangePane): bug fix 391401: set pane
	width based on the font char width...

2008-05-19  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.12

2008-05-19  Sanford Amstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ChangesPane): add 'UpdateVisible'
	method, and pass wizard through to update sensitivity on 'Apply'
	only when we have a transaction.
	(PackageSelector): pass wizard through to ChangesPane.
	(YGPackageSelector): pass wizard through to PackageSelector &
	disable Apply initially. bug #390471#

2008-05-19  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGProgressBar::setValue): clamp the
	value to calm warnings. 

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (StatusButtons): tag un-translated
	strings.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (setInstallButtonIcon): use
	gtk_button_set_image - instead of groping in the widget
	hierarchy. (createButton): do likewise.

2008-05-15  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc (findFirstFocusable, frame_label_mnemonic_activate):
	(YGFrame::YGFrame): implement mnemonics on frames - bug 390244.

2008-05-14  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: bug fix 389635: make it transient to the last
	open dialog (not necessarly the main dialog).

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added Recommended and Selected entries to
	categories.

2008-05-14  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.11

2008-05-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_enable_tree): don't let
	the tree-paned shrink below it's minimum size request:
	cf. firewall->'broadcast' oddness otherwise.

2008-05-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	Tested at 800x600 & much larger too.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (YGtkWindow): impl. new toplevel window class
	to crop size allocations to the size of the screen: ie. force no
	oversize windows with a hammer: bug 373159

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: try to gracefully handle cases where
	we are in a corner: not enough space to hand out to people
	asking for it: shrink everyone just enough. (bug 390031?)

	* src/Makefile.am (libpy2gtk_la_LIBADD): link with -lm.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (YGPackageSelector): don't try to
	resize the beastie larger than the screensize: (useful) for
	640x480 screens.

	* src/YGUI.cc (dumpGtkTree): add more debugging code, and
	re-factor existing debug code a little.

2007-05-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: feature request 388068: stock icon for
	"Install".

2008-05-12  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.10

2008-05-12  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/pkg-selector-help.h, src/YGPackageSelector.cc
	(Ypp::PkgListener): translate later when we have the
	textdomain setup correctly.

	* src/YGUI.cc (YGUI::setTextdomain): impl.
	* src/YGi18n.h: add TEXTDOMAIN / dgettext / dngettext
	to the calls.

	* POTFILES: add missing files-to-be-translated.

2008-05-09  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c (ygtk_ratio_box_size_request): remove
	the size cropping - potentially re-opening #373159 - which I
	can't reproduce.
	* tests/Wizard.ycp: add test case for bug 388715.

2008-05-09  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c (ygtk_field_entry_set_focus),
	* src/YGInputField.cc (doSetKeyboardFocus): set focus correctly
	on YInputFields #388718#

2008-05-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed bug 386536: be more strict in the
	enforcement of a repository filter:
	1st: was showing upgrades for other repositories if the filtered
	repository had any version for it, even if an older one.
	2nd: make sure context menu and collective installs, use the filtered
	repository.
	3rd: popup a dialog to confirm the installation of dependencies needed
	from other repositories than the filtered one.
	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: added a setFavoriteRepository() method and a
	callback for the interface to confirm a package from a repository
	different than that.
	Also replaced the usage of integers for Repositories and Versions for
	an actual pointer.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added support for links in package
	descriptions.

2008-05-07  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* Version 2.16.9
	
2008-05-07  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGDialog.cc (class YGWindow): only set 'fullscreen' on the main
	window - if we set it on the popups: not only do they bloat to the
	full screen size (not what we want), but they disappear behind the
	main window in a highly strange way #385563#

2008-05-06  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc (YGTree): fixed bug 381648 - 2nd issue - `open was not
	working at start -- it seems GtkTreeView changes the collapse/expand
	state when changing row properties. Also blocked item->setOpen() being
	called at start.

	* src/YGTable.cc: request bug 387114: don't grab focus when a ycp
	program sets a row selected in a table-widget.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageControl): massaged it a little more
	for bug 381689, so it fits 800x600.

	* src/YGTable.cc (YGTree): fixed bug 381648 - 3rd issue - make
	`open state behaving mimic that of -qt.

2008-05-05  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* Fixed y2log warnings across the various files: y2error() ->
	yuiError().

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: fixed 381195: Query items of DumbTab broken with Gtk.

	* src/YGLayout.cc: set all buttons of same height.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: fixed bug 373160: support all radio buttons
	being disabled.

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed bug 381746: immediateMode() can now change
	return on run-time.
	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed bug 381648: let libyui know when the user
	expands and collapses rows.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: fixed bug 384135: warning cause of disconnecting a
	signal when was never connected.
	* src/YGUtils.cc: fixed bug: scroll YLog text down properly.

	* src/YGWizard.cc: fixed bug 384649: must re-load stock icon when
	button changes senstitive state.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: fixed bug 373159: long windows -- hack for now:
	let's make use of the new gtk layout stuff when it becomes available.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: fixed bug: growing wizard headers.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc & src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed patterns install
	state, and added popup with info about them like -qt.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc & src/ygtkzyppwrapper.cc: added highlighting for
	exact matches.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: some massage for bug 381689: reduced
	default size, changed installed version layout button a bit.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: feature request 381956: supported
	repoMgrEnabled() flag, to avoid having the "add/remove" entry
	on install.

2008-04-21  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGSelectionModel.cc (findByText): implemented.

2008-04-21  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGSelectionModel.cc (findByText),
	* src/YGComboBox.cc (setText): stub switching to an existing
	entry if a setText for an existing item comes in (on a non-editable
	combo box) - instead of failing. No impl yet.
	
	* src/ygtksteps.c (ygtk_steps_get_step_layout): don't return a
	NULL layout_bold layout.
	(ygtk_steps_size_request): init w & h to 0 at least in case of NULL
	layout.

2008-04-16  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>
	
	* src/YGUI.cc, src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fix a few format warnings.
	* src/ygdkmngloader.c: fix unitialized variable

2008-03-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed Patterns install_packages() warning.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: as requested by bug #373474, don't hide
	package info/control view once shown, and don't let it overlap the
	first selected package (in fact, we make sure a selection is always
	visible when the list/icon view changes size).

2008-03-14  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageControl): fixed memory leak, on
	available combo model.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): added Setup entry that fires the
	`repo_mgr event, in order to launch the RepoManager in the new sw_single
	code.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): renamed Setup to the more descriptive
	"Add or Remove". This is also the terminology used in Gnome apps like the
	encoding menu in gnome-terminal.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (DiskView): get rid of focus drawing on the disk
	view.

2008-03-13  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.h/c: added support for an extra button.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: added functions to import/exportList, and
	createSolverTestcase.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added Tools button with the options to
	import and export the patterns/packages list, and to output a solver
	testcase to a file.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: splitted Ypp::Pool into QueryPool and TreePool.
	The first is the usual live pool that filters packages to the specified
	query. TreePool lays the packages of a specified type (like Patterns)
	under category nodes.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc & src/ygtkzyppwrapper.cc/h: modified PackagesView,
	Collections::Pool (ie. Patterns) and zypp model to support the TreePool.

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.h/c: added API with a couple of align floats to better
	place the popup.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (DiskView): center popup horizontally.

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.h/c: bug fix: menu button not released for non-native
	popups.

2008-03-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: replaced specific GtkTextView-scroll set function by a
	generic one and a specific convenience one.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Categories): bug fix: make sure the "All" item
	is selected if none is (which could happen if the user collapsed the node
	of the current selected item). Because the timing and lack of info from
	the related GTK signal, this required a hack, that gets fired in the next
	idle state after selection is changed.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageDetails): hide expanders of information
	not available.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageDetails): added Dependencies expander
	with RPM Requires and Provides (if there's interest, we'll add more, and
	show for available versions too.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageDetails): scroll up when a package
	is selected.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Categories): it seems we don't actually need to
	hack the previous bug fix.

2008-03-09  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: padded 4 pixels to the left margin.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix: change wizard headers to the selected color,
	and listen to style changes.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: some commented debug code for when not online.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: removed locking and undo from the ordinary
	controls, and added them to the popup menu.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: de-coupled package information and controls, and
	changed the layout of them.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): italic for available versions
	repositories.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: de-activate some of the popup items when a package
	is locked.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageControl): set installed version label
	selectable.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageControl): bug fix: force packages control
	to be re-loaded on change.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: packagers tend to list Authors in the description
	field; work around that.

2008-03-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (resolveProblems): zypp changed the semantics of
	the conflict details. They now need to be inlined to the string.

2008-02-27  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: got rid of depreacated warning.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (DiskView): highlight near full disk on table.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: help-background.png no longer shipped with 11.0. Disable
	help dialog background.

	* src/YGIntField.cc (YSlider): don't draw values (that's what the side
	int field is for).

	* src/YGLayout.cc: removed label alignment tweak for non-stretchable widgets.

	* src/YGUI.h/cc: sync with libyui changes: moved some methods from YUI to YApplication.

	* src/YGComboBox.cc / YGSelectionModel.cc/h: bug fix: honor select item flag
	when on editable mode.

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc (YGRichText): bug fix (#365257): honor default text
	when on plain text mode.
	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc (YGRichText): libyui sync: support toggle function
	between plain text and rich text mode.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: truncate repository combo at the 25th character.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: added 10.3 zypp compatibility flag.

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc & src/ygtkbargraph.c: honor bar graph segment's custom color.

2008-02-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (DiskView): fixed #363473 and enabled as a
	popup button.

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c: ensure popup is placed inside the screen, and
	allowed custom widget as label.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: int -> size_type.

2008-02-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: removed Language user-option.

2008-02-21  Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.de>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: commented out Language support as it is no longer
	supported by libzypp.

2008-02-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: bug fix: use "string::size_type", not "unsigned int". That's
	just asking for problems on 64-bits systems.

	* src/YGTable.cc (YGTree): honor new immediate flag.

2008-02-17  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc (escapeMarkup): optimized.

2008-02-15  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h/.cc, YGCCGtk.cc & YGComboBox.cc: libyui sync.

2008-02-05  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h/.cc: libyui sync: moved glyph() from YUI to YApplication.

	* src/YGDialog.h/.cc: fixed new open/activate().

2008-02-03  Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.de>

	* src/YGUI.cc/h: libyui sync.

2008-02-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: licenses were being rejected regardless
	user's acceptance.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Christian Jäger asked for an Update All button.
	Added a context menu to the listing, that has among package actions, a Select
	All item, so to make it clear it supports multi-selections and one can easily
	select-all then the upgrade button.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: keep up with libyui changes.

2008-02-03  Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.de>

	* src/YGUI.cc/h: maintaince: keep up with libyui changes.

2008-01-24  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: bug fix: honor tab default flag.

	* src/YGCheckBoxFrame.cc: bug fix: setEnabling() is now setEnabled().

2008-01-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: bug fix: clear icon hidden on delete, and not shown
	on some cases (see the selector).

2008-01-17  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/pkg-selector-help.h: added help to package selector. Thanks to
	Christian Jäger for writting the 1st version of the help.

2008-01-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc, src/YGLayout.cc & src/YGWidget.cc: ditched the old
	sync-stretchable approach by an iteration on YDialog::setSize() (called
	by UI::Recalc() and similar).
	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/.c: merged and removed some calls.

	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c: bug fix: mnemonic on YGTextEntry (and also, but less
	significatively, to YGDate and YGTime) was not functional.

	* src/YGTable.c: bug fix: trees looked awful. Made everything use our
	YGtkCellRendererTextPixbuf.

2008-01-15  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGBusyIndicator): implemented YBusyIndicator
	(which is an undetermined progress bar). IMHO its semantics are a bit
	contrived...

	* You may notice some layout glitches, like the labels alignment on the tools
	initialization screens. The thing is that we sync layout properties when
	widgets are added or removed from a container, but with the new libyui,
	properties like hstretch are not set on the constructor, and on the other hand,
	widgets are now added to containers at the constructor, so layout properties are
	only set afterwards.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc (YGRadioButton & Group): bug fix: not working, looks
	like we have to add the button to the group ourselves. And re-written the thing.

2008-01-13  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: we weren't escaping description text.

2008-01-11  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed search: ignore cases.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: renamed Accept to Apply.

2008-01-11  Boyd Timothy  <btimothy@novell.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Added the icon files in icons/* to
	  EXTRA_DIST so that `make package-local` will build
	  a usable tarball.

	* ChangeLog: Adjusted ChangeLog entries made earlier
	  this year to be 2008 and not 2007.  :)

2008-01-11  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: replaced ATK hooks; should work fine now.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: when paned, fixed child destruction, and init position.

2008-01-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: changed title to "Patch Selector" for
	online update.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed changelog (markup typo :/). changed
	date format.

	* src/YGLayout.cc (YGAlignment): some changes there; doesn't yet fix
	alignment issues though...

	* src/YGUtils.cc: got rid of strcmp and contains. To use library
	equivalents.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc (Query): status attributes are inclusive
	(somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the fields... -- we may want
	to unit them in one field, or add proper query conditions).

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): show upgrades also on Available
	for patches (another inconsistency -- with regard to the packager -- but
	should be intuitive).

	* src/YGPackageSelector (resolver stuff): polishing with regard to long
	strings.

2008-01-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h/cc: keep up with libyui: file dialogs moved to YApplication.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ChangesPane, Filters & PackageDetails): don't
	enable package management for patches.
	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: show summary on patches list, and show reboot needed
	info on description text.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): don't show upgrade status button for
	patches (not applicable).

2008-01-05  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper (Query): reordered query checks for performance.

	* src/yzyppwrapper (Query): search was still broken it seems... This results
	on a incohrence on the API...

2008-01-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper (Query): bug fix: search broken.

2008-01-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ChangesPane): don't try building it at start;
	there aren't changes for sw_single.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: allow multiple matches for attributes.

2007-12-30  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkzyppwrapper.cc: noticed, from another project, that we should handle
	some special cases there on the model. I guess the views aren't using them,
	but we better.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: hide Patches entry for ordinary package management
	(sw_single doesn't init patches, so only installed were shown, which could fool
	the user into not using the online_update).
	Of course, we are still pooling patches for the changes pane. We need to improve
	filtering to avoid this. We could allow for multiple instances of some Filter object
	for a Pool, acting on them as if they were an union. But I guess I'd just
	do that in a Field-basis.

2007-12-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc (Pool): build pool even for unintialized types.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ChangesPane): reflect pool at start. A bit hacky,
	besides we may want to do this only for Patches...

2007-12-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGMultiProgressMeter): bug fix: bad testing,
	was causing bar vertical to be created horizontal.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: set bold those attributes on description.

2007-12-18  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): added tooltip to repositories combo.
	Changed example of seach entry.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: filter pathes that don't apply. Don't show
	broken patches as installed.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: bug fix: fixed crash on empty pool primitives.

2007-12-17  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (Filters): adjust the interface first before
	processing the query. bug fix: query was being built against old categories
	value.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: ensure the packages primitive pool is built when we
	ask for its category.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (ChangesPane): "Undo" as tooltip text for undo icon
	button.

2007-12-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added tooltip to search entry.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc: fixed default button focus.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: don't show size for patches (zypp always reports
	zero).

2007-12-14  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: re-worked the package selector with input
	from some people. Special thanks to Christian Jäger and Martin Szulecki.
	I am confident people will like it; some code is pretty hacked through,
	this baby certainely deserved more time, but its beatiful how everything
	works together and the interface presents itself gracefully.
	Also fixed a few issues and added support for patches.

	* configure.in.in: error when using on older versions of libyui than of
	the recent API change. Also, got rid of old test code for zypp2 and
	libyui plugin.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: tweaked expanders on categories tree: put them
	next to text for packages, hide them for patches.

	* configure.in.in: changed the libyui test to a file test, since I'm not
	sure the yast2-core version has changed as a result of the new libyui.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: got rid of package ids. Pointers serve as ids fine.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: small touch up on the Changes pane.

2007-12-09  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h.cc: fixed package selector issue. We weren't implementing
	UI::RunPkgSelector() (removed it on cleanup...).

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: fix part widgets destroying; possible mem-leak.

2007-12-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkcellrenderertextpixbuf.c: fix: honor align for icons too.

	* src/YGTable.cc: simplified table sorting code; GTK+ has convinience
	functions for these, I was doing all the work myself, connecting header
	clicks, providing a sort callback, changing sort icons, .. :P Honored
	YTable::setKeepSorting().

2007-12-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* Some fixes overall. YGTree and YGMultiSelectionBox were not working.
	Polished YGSelectionModel. Fixed support for icons.

	* ygtkcellrenderertextpixbuf.h/c: a cell renderer that combines both
	GtkCellRendererText and GtkCellRendererPixbuf. We need this as yast can
	set either an icon or text on a cell, or both.

	* src/YGUtils.h/cc: cleanup of methods.
	* src/YGTable.cc (YGTable): fixed sorting. new libyui has this KeepSorted
	function, but GTK doesn't let us revert back to unsorted once we sort them...

2007-12-06  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* Fixed previous crash, some other problems and some improvements.
	* Weird problems left:
	+ crashes on sw_single (says we are calling a pure virtual func)
	   sometimes, it just exists normally right after the selector widget
	   appears
	+ there could be layout probs... test that
	+ radio buttons are not working

2007-12-05  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* First version: ported the all thing; getting a crash due to child
	being added to container at the YWidget() constructor, before we get to
	setup the reference to then use on the layout widget.

2007-12-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkimage.h/c: moved YGImage stuff to an actual widget impl. Added
	dim/gray when disabled as asked by bug #345506. Used the same code as gtk
	-- done at expose-time, using style engine.
	* src/YGImage.cc: according changes. Much smaller, of course.

	* tests/ImageMng.ycp: added Enable option, to test this. Very cool.

	* src/ygdkmngloader.c: bug fix: when fopen() fails, it returns null, so don't
	call fclose() on null, on error case.

2007-12-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: set label title centered (visible on our Package Selector
	as the icon is bigger than the text).

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGMultiProgressBar): made it flow from left to right
	on horizontal multi progress bars.
	* tests/MultiProgressBar.ycp: replaced MultiProgressBarVer.ycp by this with
	both orientations.

2007-11-30  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.cc: added Refresh button for the YWidget tree dialog.
	Also added an optional (at compile time) column for the valid test. Not
	much use for it though...

	* src/YGWizard.cc: bug fix (found during bug #342348). We were freeing
	YWizard button wrapper widgets which we weren't supposed to. It was just
	printing errors, instead of crashing, as libyui does a corruption testing
	before freeing a widget to avoid double freeing.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed search name query. Was not being inclusive.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.cc: fixed pools notifications on package modifications.
	The resolver only tell us of *modified* packages, not *touched*. So, if
	I set a package to install, then reverse the operation, the package is
	not considered modified. Now, this direct user modifications are no problem;
	we know about them. The problem are dependencies. Did a work around for that;
	kept the old status and do a comparasion on all packages.

2007-11-29  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: de-coupled navigation widgets: tree and steps. Tree
	will be placed in a GtkPaned next to the content.

	* src/yzyppwrapper.h/cc: Zypp bridge (aka Ypp).
	* src/ygtkzyppwrapper.h/cc: hooks a Ypp pool as a GtkTreeModel.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: initial frontend that used the new bridge.
	Will ask for the opinion of some nice people over its design.

2007-11-27  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: GTK+ doesn't fire a selected signal as a result of
	the current row being unselected because it was removed. But to play safe,
	blocked them then.

2007-11-22  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: reversed my last changes (except warning fix).
	It needs to be reviewed more careful. size_request shouldn't probably
	take weights in consideration like yast-ui. Only on allocation, when there
	is surplus of allocated area, we should use them...

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: made use of "pixels-below-lines" for padding. Fixed
	block tags comparison (was not ignoring cases). Fixed logic to check if
	character is new line '\n' or '\r' (some code typo).
	* src/YGUtils.cc: fixed comparison for leaf nodes "br" and "hr" (was not
	ignoring cases).

	* src/YGUI.cc: added DumpHtml debug dialog that goes through all RichTexts
	printing their source contents to a dialog.
	* src/YGDialog.cc: DumpHtml gets run on Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H

	* src/YGWidget.cc (YGLabeledWidget): bug fix (see hwinfo tool): was hiding
	label on empty string, but forgetting to show it, on a new string that isn't
	empty.

2007-11-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: shouldn't signal an event when an item is selected
	by code. (not the actual problem, but related to #343183).

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: fixed code typo.

2007-11-20  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: be more modest when requesting for size --
	ie. don't try to request enough size for all the children weight,
	just so they fit. Unless asked otherwise. Updated YGtkBarGraph
	and YGMultiProgressBar for this...
	TODO: we should allocate weights from the point where every
	children has been served.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: fixed warning.

2007-11-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.cc & src/YGDialog.cc: added save_y2logs command on Shift+F8
	like yast-qt.

2007-11-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUI.cc: on PollInput, run g_main_iteration() while there are
	events to process.

	* src/YGDialog.cc & YGUI.cc: improved busy cursor activation.
	* src/YGUI.cc: return NULL on events wait when there is no dialog,
	like yast-qt (some weirdo YCP prog could do it...)

	* src/YGUI.cc: uncommented YGUI::beep() implementation. Looks like
	my patch was accepted on yast-core (I wish I was notified for those
	API changes though).
	* tests/Beep.ycp: removed, now shipped as a yast-ui example.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: added stock icon mapping for English locale.
	Soon yast-qt will get bug reports to implement the same thing, and
	they will push for the yast-ui guy a more universal way to allow for
	that.

2007-11-11  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h/cc & YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix #340555: package
	manager post-selection process hangs when trying to exit (by the window
	manager: e.g. Alt+F4). You need to unset the callback thing that was
	installed on YGDialog for the "Abandon Changes" dialog.

	* src/YGUI.cc: bug fix: cannot abort package manager post-selection
	process (related to previous). We were not implementing UI::PollInput(),
	which is a non-blocker UI::UserInput() used by this kind of processes.
	* example/PollInput.ycp: a test case for User & PollInput().

2007-11-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: bug fix, dialog on disk.ycp tool was gutted.
	Unsigned types involved on arithmetic operation resulting in some overflows. 
	As an extra issue size_request is not returning the exact size needed
	(maybe a round problem?)

	You should sent this upstream ASAP since it renders the disk tool useless 
	(in case you have sent a package upstream after Oct 11, which I guess was
	when the bug was introduced: r41393.)

2007-10-31  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c: simplified menu pos code.

2007-10-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc: improved look of the multi-progress-bar. Made
	it growing completely from bottom to top.

	* tests/MultiProgressMeterVer.ycp: test case.

2007-10-25  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/c, YGProgressBar.cc, YGWidget.cc: bug
	fix 309049. A ratio box can request for a very big size when using weights
	so that its	children are all visible. Added a max_width/height property
	to YGtkMinSize and renamed it to YGtkAdjSize. Set it for MultiProgressMeter.

	* tests/MultiProgressMeterHuge.ycp: test case.

2007-10-23  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (class YGPatchSelector): Use the more
	sophisticated logic taken from YQPkgPatchList::fillList to
	determine what patches are available (#336124)

2007-10-22  Boyd Timothy  <btimothy@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Removed the space before the question mark
	in the "Abandon all changes?" dialog.  Also changed from Ok/Cancel to
	Yes/No buttons to follow HIG more closely.

2007-10-17  Boyd Timothy  <btimothy@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Fixed the code so it only shows
	packages that are not installed or have an update.  Fixes
	bug #300737.  Also added an enum for the GtkTreeStore
	columns so the code is easier to read.

2007-10-16  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkhtmlwrapper.h/c (added): to be used instead of YGtkRichText directly.
	At the moment, it wraps YGtkRichText and GtkHTML, YGtkRichText being the
	one used (for now, at least).

	* src/YGUtils.cc: fixed a small memory leak when a html comment, and
	disabled the removal of whitespaces (as needed by <pre>).
	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: moved block and block&ident tags to common code.
	For block tags, I am simply using two break lines, instead of spacing.
	This could still use more polishing...

	* src/YGRichText.cc: removed, moved to YGMultiLineEdit.cc, made the factory
	constructing another object for plainText.

	* configure.in.in: added GtkHtml check (uncommented as I dunno how to
	make it optional; and either way, needs to be discussed what we want here).

2007-10-12  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygdkmngloader.h/c / src/YGImage.cc: added support for inline MNG
	images. Fixed ticks per second. 
	* tests/YGImage.ycp: added a bunch of MNGs I found...

	* src/ygtkhtmltext.h/c: added wrapper around our YGtkRichText and GtkHtml.
	-> Automake stuff needs works (it will just error if GtkHtml is not found...)
	* src/YGRichText.cc & src/YGPackageSelector.cc: bug fix #326207: use
	ygtkhtmltext code.

	Doing our own renderer was fun, but it won't ever support tables, and still
	has some corner cases where GMarkup complains, and inline/blocks tags are
	problematic at times. And I already saw comments of people doing tables and
	using HTML extensively on yast (like for a startup screen).
	With a wrapper we can easily port the code to another HTML widget out there,
	until gtk+ adopts one into the API. GtkHTML API is a bit sucky, but its
	used by Evolution (including on the composer), so its robust, and it seems
	fairly slim (certainely when compared to mozdev :P).

2007-10-11  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: speed up Patterns view. 

	* src/ygtkratioboxh.h/c: bug fix #326144: the layout algorithm
	should be the same as yast-core. It was ignoring the insane yast
	some policies, including the layout-stretch (also called rubber-band)
	variable.

	* src/YGTable.cc: bug fix: Comunity Repos tool was showing descriptions
	on single click. Moved the event hooks to the different Table-like
	implementations, as they differ in subtlety.

	* src/YGWidget.h: added getDebugLabel() which is our replacement for
	YWidget::debugLabel() which is of little use for most widgets.
	* src/YGLayout.cc (YGAlignment): added align info to YGAlignment's
	getDebugLabel().
	* src/YGUI.cc: improved YWidget Tree dialog (ctrl+alt+shift+T).

	* src/YGWidget.cc: added delay flag to emitEvent() (waits 250 ms
	then tries to send it if nothing is pending).

	* testcases:
	* tests/Layout-AlignStretch.ycp: the #326144 bug.
	* tests/MultiSelectionBox.ycp: the other bug mentioned.

	* src/YGTable.cc: forgot to block new hook: select_delayed_cb when
	changing selection.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: seems like we aren't being completely faithful to
	yast-core. Made widget base-size with the boss algo from yast-core.

	* src/YGTable.cc: bug fix #327492: always make one row selected. This isn't
	documented behavior, and the YCP code is at fault here, but we probably
	should emulate the other interfaces.

	* src/ygtksteps.c: bug fix #328500: steps may be truncated when they get
	highlighted. Calculate size_request as if they are all highlighted.
	TODO: we may want to get rid of PangoLayout in favor of the simpler Cairo.

	* src/ygdkmngloader.h/c: bug fix #328500: added loader for MNG image.
	(just a very small subset of it). There is a bug on movies limited to
	a fixed iteration number -- it seems that ticks per second is calculated
	different for them; have to see...
	* tests/YGImage.ycp: added a MNG image and updated test.

2007-10-10  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed bug #330467. Do a full match to
	map patterns wanted packages for the packages in the pool.

	* fixed a couple of warnings.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: fixed bug #330777. The value we need to return from the
	delete-event callback (close window) is always True, because we don't want
	GTK destroying the window for us. We just want to let YCP know about it,
	and then YCP does it explicitely if and when it wants to.
	For the record, the abandon dialog from the package selector is working. Neat
	dialog btw.

2007-10-03  Boyd Timothy  <btimothy@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Use the "available" name to sort
	the tree views.  This makes the Available Software list be
	sorted properly.

2007-10-03  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: don't re-render the progress bar
	so much when building the package tree: ~20% speedup.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageSelector): turn off searching
	description, too slow.	
	(fastGetSummary): implement cache for summaries - hugely
	accelerates searching etc. at cost of some memory.

2007-08-26  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (does_package_match_one):
	don't fetch the obj unless we need to - hugely accelerates
	search.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (PackageSelector): use
	search_activate_cb for 'activate' on the entry, so we
	don't wait 1 second when the user hits 'enter' ;-)

2007-08-25  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: merge two gtk_tree_model_gets.
	(checkDelete): use this to get user confirmation on exit if
	there are unsaved changes etc. n#300390

	* src/YGDialog.cc (close_window_cb, setDeleteCallback): add
	ability to set a custom dlete callback.
	(currentYGDialog): expose as YGDialog.

	* src/YGDialog.h: add: needed in YGPackageSelector.

2007-08-22  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc (YGProgressBar): implement pulse
	mode when maxprogress == 0

	* tests/ProgressPulse.ycp: add test.

	* configure.in.in, src/Makefile: create and use PYUI_LIBS,
	to adapt likewise.

	* src/Y2CCGtk.cc (class Y2CCGtk): conditionalize new
	YUI pieces so we build with older yast2's.

2007-08-10  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* po/pt.po: remove - causing grief with 'make package'

2007-08-08  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* VERSION: 2.15.8, Revision 40088

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (acceptLicense): 
	details on how to print the license: FaTE #302018

2007-07-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.6, Revison 39606

2007-07-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (sync_tree_views_scroll): this
	needs re-writing to be more efficient in corner cases: eg.
	no zypp sources. For now use an iteration timeout of 10
	loops before bailing out for a big speed win.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (compat_gtk_tree_model_filter_convert_child_iter_to_iter):
	back-compat method for older gtk+s (SLED10).

	* configure.in: autodetect pre ZYPP 3 version, and adapt
	accordingly.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (induceObjects): fix tribool related
	crasher n#293065.
	(PackageSelector): remove m_searching, in favour of the more robust
	!m_search_queries.empty()

	* src/YGImage.cc (YGImage::initOptions): set m_isScaled, m_isTiled
	before we use them; kill valgrind uninitialized value error churn.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: handle 0 size partitions,
	also don't warn for "out of space" errors on < 1Mb partitions:
	discarding the annoying warning dialog.
	(PROGRESS): guard against divide-by-zero too.

2007-07-19  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Jiri has added gettext support (not sure
	if it is completed as I don't see the place for PO files and the rules
	to compile them), so set package selector strings as translatable _( ... ).

	* po/pt.po: created this translation; dunno how to make the thing
	being used now...

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added pre-3 zypp version compatibility; just
	uncomment #define PRE_ZYPP_3

2007-71-16  Jiri Srain     <jsrain@suse.cz>

	* moved changelog to package subdir, added .spec.in and -yast2-gtk-rpmlint
	files

2007-07-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: ported to zypp3 from alpha6:
	+ the SourceManager/Source API has been renamed to RepoManager/Repository
	/RepoInfo and suffered some changes.
	+ missing include: zypp/Package.h

2007-06-29  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: bug fix: rolled out «let the selection event be
	fired, when yast programatically selects a tree view item» (was
	breaking sudo and firewall tools).

2007-06-21  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc (YGScrolledWidget): Because SelectionBox and others don't
	request for a size, they allocate their size by using weights. It will
	look good on yast-qt default window size (at least with default fonts...),
	but will suck for us since we use a window size that we adjust as necessary.
	Made it so that child enforces its size up to 120 pixels.
	This doesn't fix the fact that there should be a maximum size on auxiliary
	widgets, like a list, for aesthetics.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/c (YGtkScrolledWindow): extended GtkScrolledWindow
	so that automatic policy is more grained; you can set scroll bars to only
	be used above a certain size of the child.

2007-06-20  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	Banshee's labels and table text is truncated with the "..." string
	added when they don't have enough space. Checked their source code
	to see the text cell renderer they have done for the purpose. No
	custom text cell renderer... Then, I noticed that git-view also does
	it. Checking GTK+ docs, Pango offers that wrapping mode (ellipsize,
	they call it). Really nice, so made use of it:

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: wrap using ellipsize. This doesn't
	force us to set a wrapping width, so setted the column expandable.
	Makes the selector looking better when expanded.

	* src/YGTable.cc: used ellipsize for the last column, generally used
	for descriptions (see runlevel, printer, etc).

	* src/ygtkwizard.cc: sometimes the header text is so big, that the
	window must be enlarged. Made it using ellipsize, and set a minimum
	width of 40 pixels.

2007-06-20  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.4 - Rev 38929

2007-06-20  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc (YGCheckBoxFrame::setEnabling): fix up.
	(YGCheckBoxFrame::setLabel): handle mnemonic properly.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c (ygtk_ratio_box_forall): make static.

	* src/test.cc, src/YGWidget.cc, *.c: add missing config.h includes.

	* src/YGFrame.cc: include config.h so we get YAST2_VERSION,
	so we get the CheckBoxFrame conditional right.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c (ygtk_ext_entry_new): fix prototype.
	(ygtk_find_entry_new): correct prototype / impl. mismatch.
	(ygtk_find_entry_actual_popup_menu): correct prototype.
	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c (ygtk_menu_button_new),
	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c (ygtk_filter_entry_new),
	(ygtk_field_entry_new): fix prototype.

	* src/YGUI.cc (errorMsg): use a '%s' format for msg.

2007-06-19  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: fix: let the selection event be fired, when yast
	programatically selects a tree view item. Also center it, disallow
	unselection and fixed memory leak.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc:
	+ fix bad behavior when undoing a package set to update.
	+ fixed libzypp hang when queried for sources that were disabled.
	+ use libzypp Unit utility to convert partition disk size integer
	  to a nice size string (for the disk usage graph).
	+ set font package description italic when user modifies its 
	+ putted sources and disk usage table into notebook pages.
	+ fixed code for multi-selections.
	+ fixed pattern / language management.
	+ don't allow selections on groups.

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed last work; when a table is sorted the rows
	paths change... This has broken our yast row to gtk row id proxy...
	Re-worked using another approach.

	* src/YGWidget.cc: fixed: labels that were putted in top of some
	widgets (like the progress bar) were being wrapped for no reason.

2007-06-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGFrame.cc: re-factored some code into a common YGBaseFrame and
	created GtkAlignment once while getting rid of the custom addChild.

	Michael: sorry if YGCheckBoxFrame doesn't compile, and give it a try. :/
	Btw, YGCheckBoxFrame::setEnabling() looks weird. Shouldn't the argument
	have a purpose?

	* src/YGTable.cc: sorting was broken. Made it sorting by the first
	column by default, as yast-qt.

	* src/YGTable.cc: for the MultiSelectionBox, where the user pressed the
	toggle button, allow also him to press enter/space or double-click the row.

	* src/YGTable.cc: because of yast-ncurses/qt, Yast tools expect it to
	be impossible for the user to un-select a row (which GTK+ allows by pressing
	Control while clicking on the row). Disabled that.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: F1 opens help dialog.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/c: got rid of the packing property. Not used and is
	broken anyway. Touched a few more files.

	* src/YGUtils.h/cc: some cleanup.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: some initial easter egg. :) Press Ctrl+Alt+Shit+E, wait
	10 secs. :)

2007-06-12  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: oops, looks like GtkTreeView built-in search wasn't
	working for our YMultiSelection, since the first column are booleans.

2007-06-11  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (does_package_match): use some
	more google-like 'AND' vs. 'OR' syntax, default to AND.
	
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc (acceptLicense): pack the
	license_view into the right widget, and set expand/fill.
	(does_package_match_one): split from
	(does_package_match): allow "and"ing our keywords
	together to narrow search, rather than or'ing, and default
	to 'and'.
	(acceptLicense): make the license_view a rich text view.

	* src/YGProgressBar.cc: use BOTTOM_TO_TOP instead of top_to_bottom,
	makes the package install bar look more 'normal' (?) usual for
	thermometers, equalizers, volume controls etc.

2007-06-10  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc:
	  + some improvements for package description text.
	  + added sources widgets which not only lists package sources, but
	  lets you enable/disable them (might be cool to actually allow it to
	  manage them; add and remove them, but that should be quite some work
	  -- can of course be considered -- we can't unfortunately just use
	  the sources yast module, at least as it is, since zypp is locked by
	  us...
	  + added disk widget, which lists partitions and their usage. Also fires
	  up a warning dialog when disk left space gets below 80Mb (only once...).
	  + start of multi-selections support (BROKEN though).

	NOT to be sent upper stream.

2007-06-02  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: don't blindly accept the row passed by a YCP app, might
	be out of range. It didn't crash or anything, since the map find should
	return the last one, but handle it sensibly now.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added patterns and languages view. (Installing
	or removing a pattern/language doesn't yet work, only packages under them.)
	Removed the PatternSelector class. All bundled now.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: show a progress window when changing views.
	Was gonna use threads at first, but decided to just flush gtk events at
	some points. No disadvantages, I would call this userspace threading :P,
	and its much simpler.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Done a lot of string treatment for the Package
	Details expander tabs. In particular, if nautilus is present, the file list
	dirs will be clicked and nautilus fired on them. (gnome_view_url() would
	been better, especially since it seems gnome stuff will be moved to /usr;
	but it's a too small feature to justify linkage).

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: function API changed. Also touched files
	that use this widget.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: when handling xml, cut comments (<!-- -->). Added
	function to replace by \n for <br>, or <p>. If text has <!-- DT:Rich -->
	don't escape it.
	* src/test.cc: updated.

2007-05-23  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: changed title alignment.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: overload entry's context menu key binding
	by our own, if set (see package selector).

	* src/YGUI.cc: ignore widgets without YGWidget representation
	(ie. YWizard buttons wrappers).

2007-05-22  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: expand all nodes on the conflicts
	dialog tree.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: when it has a context menu, draw a arrow
	on the icon to indicate it (see the package selector).

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: when help dialog's search text is not found,
	use the same red of Firefox on the search. Also set text white.

2007-05-12  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: when clicking in a package, even if
	it isn't on the other view, scroll view to the closest package.
	(to fix: when moving packages, it scrolls badly.)
	Remove version handlers from groups, and bold package names.

2007-05-11  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.3, Revision 446+

2007-05-11  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (rt_end_element): harden vs. missing close htags.
	(rt_start_element): fix crasher n#271716 - the first element has no
	front element.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c (ygtk_ext_entry_get_border_window_size),
	(ygtk_ext_entry_set_border_window_size),
	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_add_step_header): convert g_asserts
	to g_return_if_fails - so we don't abort when the .ycp does something
	unexpected.

2007-05-10  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: don't allocate space for invisble windows.
	Found out why SphereCrystal (and likely other styles that make use
	of the background drawing) was getting cutted. GtkEntry re-calculates
	the text area for drawing the background, instead of just getting its
	geometry (reported bug+patch).
	Centered find/clear icon vertically. Some styles have higher entries
	and this was noticeable.

	(Aaron Bockover has re-written Banshee's search entry using its old
	approach. Dunno what he thought of our code. Ours may be considered
	a bit more complex -- 454 vs 472 lines btw --, but I'd say its more elegant.
	Its also more flexible, and a bit more efficient (his approach requires
	GTK layouting to kick in at times, since it works by compounding widgets;
	eg. when hovering a icon, it replaces the icon with a container_add() and
	a _remove().
	His aproach may also break more easily. For instance, it treats xthickness
	and ythickness as having the same value (avoiding that would mean cluttering
	the code with layout handling).
	So, I think ours is a keeper.
	Sent him a patch for honoring non-interior_focus styles -- eg. Glider
	(not completely exact, but its not really noticeable).)

2007-05-07  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c: bug fix: due to cleanup entry was not accepting
	text when valid chars were not set.

	* src/YGWizard.cc: we need to export wizard three buttons as YPushButtons,
	so that YUI::ChangeWidget() can be used on them. This seems to overlap with
	Wizard API and I dunno why they didn't just adopt one approach. My guess
	is that some dude just start using this (ncurses supports this as it's done
	using yui), and -qt just adopted it.
	sysconfig tool needs fixing.

	* src/YGWizard.cc: sysconfig tool fixed; we weren't implementing
	YGWizard::currentTreeSelection(); simple function; not so simple
	to found it missing. :)
	* tests/WizardList.ycp: respective test case.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: replace "&nbsp;" by " ".

2007-05-03  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtk*: unified the code style of our widgets. Most standing,
	declarations are avoided, and overloading is done at the end. This
	reduces the	points you need to change when adding/removing a function.

2007-05-02  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: re-written it to my initial vision. Before,
	it was based on the music player's Banshee one, though it did some more
	work to look closer to a GtkEntry. When I sent a patch to the guys,
	they reported a couple of visual issues. They were minor and I even
	fixed one of them; the other, having it integrated into external
	focus style entries, seemed to require a different approach. Few
	styles use this, and it looked okay anyway. But was getting unhappy
	with the code, so did this re-write, which I'm really happy with. :)

	* src/ygtkfindentry.h: from the description:
	YGtkExtEntry extends GtkEntry adding two optional GdkWindows, at each
	horizontal corner, which are created at demand. Very useful to create
	a panel, an icon or something inside of it.
	GtkTextView provides something similar and would be nice to have this
	right on GtkEntry; in fact, GtkSpinButton could be simplified if it
	were for this.
	Right-to-left is supported at this level (borders are mirrored, if it
	is set). If you don't want that, use gtk_widget_set_direction().

	YGtkFindEntry is a convinience widget that has a find icon, with an
	optional menu, at the left, and an erase icon at the right.

	(Will ask Aaron Bockover to look at the code; won't be porting it
	to C# anytime soon though.)

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc / src/ygtkwizard.c: modified to cope with
	new API.

	* src/YGTable.cc: when selecting a row, also center it in the view.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: got rid of the need for the
	ygtk_find_entry_modify_base() method as opposite to gtk_widget_modify_base().
	Made sure size_request was enough for the icon.

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c: added Banshee-based nice hover effect.

2007-04-19  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: re-allowed user to press Enter on search
	entry to re-do search. TODO: probably we want when a search option
	is changed for the search to be re-done.

2007-04-17  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.2, Revision 431

2007-04-17  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtksteps.c (ygtk_steps_new): explicit void prototype.
	(ygtk_steps_append, ygtk_steps_append_heading): add pre-conditions,
	works around crash on start in update.ycp

	* src/ygtkcellrendererarrow.c (point_under_arrow): don't use
	GTK_ARROW_NONE for signalling - not present in gtk 2.8

	* src/YGUI.h: create new YAST2_YGUI_CHECKBOX_FRAME define, that
	(hopefully) captures the correct semantics of when the checkboxframe
	is available.

2007-04-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkfindentry.c/h: new widget; a GtkEntry with a clear icon on
	the right, and a find icon on the left. My first idea was to implement
	this by adding a couple of GdkWindows to a GtkEntry, and limitate the
	text area with the "inner-border". But checked Banshee code and opted
	for their approach; using a GtkHBox inside a GtkFrame. Only I have
	not used a GtkFrame and done the frame drawing myself, so it really
	looks like a GtkEntry; also made the height to be like one of a GtkEntry.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: use YGtkFindEntry on the help dialog. Nicely dicrete.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: instead of the Customize button, then dialog;
	used a YGtkFindEntry, with a popup menu on the find icon where you can
	check the fields you wanna search for (like Banshee does).
	TODO: support google syntax on search: "python -gtk", etc. Just some of
	them...

2007-04-14  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkcellrendererarrow.c: arrows now drawn with cairo, instead of
	the pixmaps. I'm surprised they fit pretty well.
	* src/ygtkcellrendererarrow.c: trying to have pressed/normal state, but
	the events of a cell renderer are limitated to pressing. Cleanup anyway.

	* src/YGUtils.cc: correction to strcmp for different length strings
	(for him, "aa" == "aaa").
	* src/test.cc: added strcmp case.

2007-04-09  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: added alternative to gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_point()
	that does smooth scroll.

	* src/ygtkarrowcellrenererarrow.c: a cell renderer that
	displays two arrow buttons (up and down) which can be used
	as another representation of a combo or spin box.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: when a package is selected, scroll the
	other view to the same point. TODO: as the user scrolls one view, also
	make the other view scroll with respect to the sorting.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added a another column to the available
	packages view with arrow renderers. If more than one version is
	available the user can choose it using it. Most users just want to choose
	the latest version (and only tune it, less often), so this renderers
	let the user see there is no newer version, as opposite to a combo box.
	It is also much lighter than the combo box renderer. Showing all
	the different versions packages in the view would be clutter and not
	as straight forward to implement. We could put them in the same node, but
	now we have the same problem of the combo box, added with quite some
	complexity.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: Not exactly what else I did; some cleanups
	I guess. Still some rather important work to do.

	* src/YGLayout.cc / src/YGUtils*: got back necessary use of GValue.
	It seems g_object_set() != g_object_set_property().

2007-03-29  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* ycc/ycc.cpp: use /usr/share/YaST2/theme/current/ for icons,
	not /usr/share/YaST2/theme/SuSELinux/.

2007-03-26  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/YGFrame.cc / src/YGUI.h: the pre-processor yast version
	check was set as "#if YAST2_VERSION > 2014004 || YAST2_VERSION > 2013032",
	which is obviously the same as "#if YAST2_VERSION > 2013032". And
	this is not implemented for "YAST2_VERSION == 2014004" (the one
	from opensuse 10.2.

	* src/YGLayout.cc / src/YGUtils*: got rid of unnecessary use of GValue.

2007-03-16  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.1 - Rev 412

2007-03-16  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc (YGCheckBoxFrame::setLabel),
	(YGFrame::setLabel): fix daft accelerator translation
	bug & refactor to:
	* src/YGUtils.cc (setLabel): impl. helper

	* src/YGIntField.cc (class YGSpinBox): only connect to
	slider signal if we have a slider.

2007-03-15  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: fix bug 247682: convert the key to unicode.
	And some cleaning.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.h/c (YGtkMinSize): added set_only_expand() property
	which makes the child greed :), always asking for more space.
	* YGDumbTab.cc: make use of it.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (safe_stretchability): made it an exception to consider
	safe to ask for the stretchability of a ysplit without children (bug fix:
	notebook from edit in network.ycp goes stretchable in one page and not
	stretchable in the other).
	This work around for the fact that stretchable() crashes when it has no
	children should really be fixed upstream.

2007-03-15  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: remove generated file.

	* src/YGUI.h, src/YGFrame.cc: createCheckBoxFrame crept
	into the stable release post 2.13.32, adapt to that too.

2007-03-14  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* configure.in.in: use the version numbering from
	"pkg-config --modversion yast2-core" as suggested by
	Martin Vidner. Removed my has_checkboxframe check.

	* YGLayout.cc (YGAlignment): honor child stretchable when set
	stretchable (special case that YAlignment does).
	* YGWizard.cc: make use of previous; things like loading messages
	on some modules were not centered -- this fixes that.

	* YGLabel.cc: instead of using a GtkEntry for isOutputField, use
	a regular label. This supports multiple lines and from the places
	it is used it looks just as good (just made it selectable).

	* YGUtils.cc: added replace() that replaces a character in a
	string (which mapKBAccel() now uses). Fixed bug on setWidgetFont()
	(arguments were not being honored).

	* src/YGUI.cc: cleaned up the file selection code wrt path fed.
	* tests/FileDialog.ycp: easy app to test the file/folder selectors.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c: seems like I had forgotten to double some
	padding value for size request... This tiny little thing was
	reponsible for a weird warning and wasting my time. :/

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: fix bug 247682: convert the key to unicode.
	And some cleaning.

2007-03-13  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt>

	* YGPackageSelector.cc: made the package information to
	use tabs.

	* YGUI.cc: couldn't reproduce bug #247802, but cleaned
	up file chooser code as it is not good. Done a few tests;
	all fine.

	* configure.in.in & config.h.in: added HAS_CHECKBOXFRAME
	define according to if YCheckBoxFrame.h is available or
	not. YAST2_VERSION would work nice, if yast guys would
	have changed the version number since the opensuse 10.2
	release. :/

	* src/YGIntField.cc: set scale to not jump much for small
	values.

	* src/YGLayout.cc: fixes bug #247683 (crash on language.ycp).
	This also happen in programs like network.ycp, wrt a
	childless container.

2007-02-07  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.15.0 - Rev 388

	* src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): computer.xpm

	* src/YGFrame.cc (YGCheckBoxFrame::setEnabling):
	call handleChildrenEnablement.

	* Makefile.cvs: use PREFIX ?= /usr for non-pfx builds

2007-02-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc (toggled_cb): impl.

	* src/YGFrame.cc (YGFrame::setLabel): use mapKBAccel.
	(class YGCheckBoxFrame): partial impl. of YGCheckBoxFrame

	* src/Makefile.am: get $(prefix) into lib path.

	* configure.in.in: add YAST2_VERSION conditional, so we can
	build both old & new yasts from the same source base.

	* configure.in.in, Makefile.cvs, VERSION, SUBDIRS, POTFILES,
	MAINTAINER, RPMNAME: move to a more yast-like build system.

	* configure.in: remove
	* autogen.sh: update - make -f Makefile.cvs first.

2006-02-03  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* autogen.sh: use yast2-core to get libdir (the other doesn't
	seem set on 10.2)

	* computer.xpm: added. This is the Tango "computer" stock icon. Doesn't
	seem to get set on some other desktop enviornments than Gnome.

	* ygtkwizard.c: commented wrong style code.

	* integrate/yast2: use the slab thing on gnome (todo: make configurable).

	* there seems to be some unstability that may be linked with the drawing
	errors on gtk 2.10; check where this is.

2006-12-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* Started reviewing the package selector. Some features will be
	removed temporarly or not work. Check the TODO for planed changes.

	* YGPackageSelector.cc: no more sync between view modes. They are
	just reloaded when changed. This reduces the code size and complexity,
	and makes adding other view modes easier (we will probably want
	to change the patterns dialog by making it a view mode). But there
	is a drawback: performance. It can take some seconds to change
	views. This should be acceptable as the user rarely needs to change
	view modes. Users with slower machines suffer more... But then,
	they also have less memory and this reduces memory usage.

	* YGPackageSelector.cc: added computer icon to code as it is not
	available in some cases. Added a search options dialog. Added more
	information into the packages list (not fully working).

2006-12-06  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGLayout.cc: re-designed layout stuff; it got simplified
	and reduced. And should be more reliable as the layout notifies
	better modifications (this forced to create bigger "crash safe"
	measures; some YContainerWidget crash when asked for stretchable()
	and they don't have children).
	The responsability for a widget to fill a hole is now of YGSplit, not
	of the YGWidgets. The alignment is now the responsability of YGAlignment,
	not of the YGWidgets. GtkAlignment container is now longer installed on
	YGWidgets (only YGtkMinSize now -- so we may specify a min size and a
	border).

	* ygtkratiobox.c: fill argument splitted into two for horizontal and
	vertical directions.

	* YGUI.cc: turned dumpYastTree into a graphical window.
	(press ctrl+atl+shift+T)

	* integrate/yast2: fixed syntax error:
	if [ $WINDOWMANAGER | grep -qi "gnome" ]
	-> if echo $WINDOWMANAGER | grep -qi "gnome"

2006-12-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGLayout.cc: a fix to a better behavior on YSplits
	inside YSplits. Labeled widgets should now get aligned
	for all pratical cases.

	* ygtkwizard.c: YGtkHelpDialog use GtkBinding to catch
	keys rather than the key_pressed GtkWidget signal.
	(using this last would mean, for instance, Ctrl+Alt+F3
	 would be caught, where we just want to catch single F3
	 key instances.)

	* ygtkwizard.c: removed the non-functional search icon code.
	Better to see how someone else does this.

	* ygtkwizard.c: fixed gtk warnings on destroy.
	* ygtkwizard.c: fixed visual glitches on autoyast at start.

2006-11-28  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGTree.cc: stuff was being printed. Got rid of that.

2006-11-24  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* ygtkratiobox.c: fixed badly given space when homogeneous
	is set.

2006-11-21  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	Layout still has a couple of bugs (as can be seen in
	test/Layout-Split-Split.ycp and test/Layout-Wizard3.ycp),
	but better commit this or spiders may start creating webs
	here. :P

	* ygtkratiobox.c: added fully extandable flag which is the
	equivalent to set the maximum weight (that we need in YSplit
	because we don't know the max weights while adding children).
	size_request and size_allocate was re-written. Support for
	right-to-left languages and hidden widgets.

	* ygtkwizard.c: re-written size_request and size_allocate to
	comply with recent changes and simplify them.

	* YGWidget.cc / YGLayout.cc: work on having a proper layout.

	* YGLayout.cc and some YGLabeledWidget.cc-based widgets: a first
	try at having the labels horizontally aligned. Currently, it just
	checks if a YSplit child is a labeled widget, so if it is inside
	a container, it doesn't apply the same-width code to it. So,
	we must iterate through those.

2006-11-08  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGTextEntry.cc: use YGtkFilterEntry, from YGtkFieldEntry,
	rather than doing that work itself.

	* ygtkwizard.c: first try at a11y-it based on GtkAssitance.
	GOK doesn't seem to work here though (but then it doesn't
	work on many other guis, including GnomeDruid).

2006-11-07  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* YGLayout.cc & YGWidget.cc: changed layout code to use
	our own GTK based solution for the layout rather than
	the YWidget provided one. Still some minor problems, but
	it is working pretty well. The code actually was reduced
	in size because we no longer need the setSize and nicesize,
	which were also easily broken code.

	The layout uses YGtkRatioBox for the YSplit to support
	weights. Each widget is contained in a YGtkMinSize, that
	allows us to set a minimum size, which is itself contained
	in a GtkAlignment, so we may specific the widget has
	stretchable or not, among others. We could cut YGtkMinSize
	on most widgets by having that value passed by the YGWidget
	constructor, but too many arguments there would obviously
	not be very nice...

	So, this layout code has the advantages of: being simpler,
	faster and not suffering from the labels getting truncated
	problem. It also gives us let us do some hacks like, for
	instance, having labels and entries aligned horizontally...

	* YGLayout.h: removed.

	* ygtkratiobox.c: honor right-to-left languages. The API
	needs to be modified a bit in order to let it be possible
	to set a widget to be fully stretchable, independent from
	the weight. We need to fix this limitation for Layout-mixed.ycp
	test.

	* ygtkfilterentry.c: written a smaller (1110 to 230 lines), and
	what I think is more intuitve, replacement.

2006-11-04  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabel.cc: attempt at making YGColoredLabel
	working properly on KDE (for gtk-qt theme), by
	using expose, rather than putting the GtkLabel in
	a GtkEventBox. Unfortunately, it doesn't like
	filling rectangles with a frame (but I really liked
	the frame look, so I will just hope gtk-qt has fixed
	this). Either way, the code	is nicer this way.

	* ygtkmenubutton.c: use, either explicitely or
	implicitely, an aid widget to popup regular widgets.

2006-10-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: don't return failure if
	SetDialogIcon command fails - it breaks the installer.

	* HACKING: update to use gtkize-iso, removing 8 steps.

	* integrate/YaST2.call: do minimal hacks instead to
	get gtk bits running, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH too, appears
	to actually work [!]

	* gtkize-iso: s/cromfs/cramfs/ & include critical
	pango modules.

2006-10-26  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (hash_table_clear_cb, hash_table_clear) 
	(ygtk_wizard_clear_tree, ygtk_wizard_clear_steps): use
	g_hash_table_remove_all instead.
	(enable_widget): rename macros to upper-case, add _str
	variant that can handle NULL too (defensively)
	(ygtk_wizard_set_help_text): set m_help instead of
	the widget itself. (help_button_clicked_cb): set the
	help here if we show it.
	(ygtk_help_dialog_init): hide help widget on delete
	rather than destroying it & causing problems later.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc (YGPushButton): set can-default
	on all push-buttons, makes ok/cancel type dialogs
	prettier.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_destroy, destroy_hash):
	cope with double destroys.
	(ygtk_help_dialog_init): use pack_end, scope var decls,
	set CAN_DEFAULT on close button to get spacing right.
	(ygtk_wizard_realize): use gtk_wiget_get_ancestor instead
	of custom code, make static.
	(button_new): split out - and set CAN_DEFAULT.
	(destroy_string): use g_free instead.

2006-10-26  Ricardo Cruz  <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* ygtkwizard.c: re-write of it and made it based on GtkBin
	rather than GtkEventBox. We now do all the container work
	in a similar way to GtkAssistant, so the two style changeable
	settings (content-padding and header-padding) should reflect
	in this "clone" of ours as well.
	Help information is displayed in a dialog, rather than on the
	usual box.

	* ygtksteps.c: re-write and made it based on GtkWidget rather
	than GtkVBox, steps being "hand" drawn by ourselves now, rather
	than being GtkLabels. This allows for a better integration with
	YGtkWizard.

	* made a couple of improvements to the other native GTK widgets
	of ours.

	NOTE: This is all unstable work and there are known crashes and
	bugs. But I would prefer to have this on svn because it is get-
	-ting to be a pretty big change... Should we open an unstable branch?
	Or just advice the packager to stick with some svn version?
	Either way, shouldn't be too hard to squish the bugs.

2006-10-09  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* integrate/*: add Ricardo's touched files

	* gtkize-iso: 1st pass at a tool to 'gtk'ize an
	existing install ISO.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_init): add 'tt' -> monospace.

2006-10-09  Thomas Meeks  <thomas@imaginator.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (doSetSize): don't set request < -1 ever,
	prunes warning.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c (ygtk_wizard_init): add spacer & re-arrange
	padding to improve bottom button box spacing.

2006-09-27  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: cleanups; decided not to make use of signals for
	YGWindow.
	* src/YGDialog.cc & YGUI.cc: added support for --geometry, --fullscreen,
	--noborder and --nowm.

2006-09-23  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUI.h and others: disabled the debugging printing by default.
	Uncomment #define IMPL_DEBUG on YGUI.h to enable it.

	* src/YGDialog.cc: handle more than one main window properly. The bug
	that was avoiding this commit was that a label with our own pango font
	description set wasn't returning a proper size request (and this may
	happen in other cases). Setting the father container in a GtkWindow,
	rather than doing that only on showWindow() seemed to solve the issue.
	I wonder if there is a more elegant way to fix this and why it needs a
	GtkWindow as the base of the hierarchy to work...

	TO do: abstract YGWindow further. We will have to make it a GObject to
	use its signal system. And support --geometry & friends.

	TO fix: I would like to catch the escape key to send a Cancel event to
	YWidgets for popup dialogs. Somehow that doesn't seem to work -- check
	key_pressed_cb().

2006-09-19  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: bug fix: show default tab at start, and got rid of
	warnings.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: show disk usage warning when it starts getting
	full.

2006-09-15  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: some love to it: only set paragraph spacing for p, h1 and
	alike, fixed html not rendering on tools like the printer, added center and
	img tag.

2006-09-12  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGComboBox.cc, YGTable.cc: it seems that YSelectionWidget.h supports
	icons... Qt only honors them for SelectionBox, but I added support for the
	rest of the YSelectionWidget children classes as well (that is, ComboBox and
	MultiSelectionBox). Checkout the tests.

	* src/YGTable.cc: bug fix: mismatch of YCP row numbering and GtkListStore that
	was causing some glitches. Now, we use a double hash to translate between them.

	* src/YGUI.cc: busy cursor should now be set properly when a YCP program is
	doing work for some time, like Qt. UI::BusyCursor() and UI::NormalCursor()
	seem to be now obsolet methods with this approach.
	Added YGUI::beep(), currently disabled, to go with the core patch.

	* ycc.sh: re-worked a bit: pass z for examples and x for our tests. qt to also
	run the Qt frontend.

2006-09-11  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: patterns chosen should now get reflected
	on the packages list. Some minor upgrades to the interface as well.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added installation/removal of languages
	to the patterns dialog.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: improved accuracy of the dependencies list
	on confirmation dialog a lot.

2006-09-10  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: added support for upgrades (fine grading
	on right click).

2006-08-23  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: don't show available packages that are
	already installed, unless the version is different where it should
	display its version. Updating a package with a newer version is not
	yet supported which is kinda of nasty.
	(not really hard to add, but will have to wait.)

	* YGPackageSelector.cc: patch selector: don't show installed packages
	and do the job properly.

2006-08-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c: remove bogus utils.h include.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): bin yast2.txt

2006-08-23  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_init): move link_color
	upwards, so the constructor can set it up.

2006-08-22  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: quick fix for the unsupported "one main dialog
	to rule them all" functionality that yast requires.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc , src/YGTable.cc & src/YGTree.cc: added
	g_object_unref() for all models. I thought GtkTreeView would assume
	ownership, but it just refs them. So, even if after
	gtk_tree_view_set_model() we need to unref them.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: show software dependencies and requirments
	on summary window.
	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: search implemented.

	* src/YGImage.cc: bugfix: image was getting cut due to not
	honoring borders on drawing.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: fixed problem solver.

	* src/YGTable.cc, src/YGPackageSelector.cc and YGUtils.cc: set columns
	sortable on the patch selector, and set it sorted on severity by default.
	(GTK is nothing trivial on this respect, but it gives us a lot of power,
	 so we can sort by severity not by string. I mean, the severity string
	 doesn't necessarly mean the least severe to the most severe...)

2006-08-21  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YWidget.cc: fixed menomnic on scrolled widget and hide label
	when passing empty string, as agreed with Stefan.

	* src/ygtkwidget.c & src/YGTree.cc: fixed that oldie bug of autoyast
	flickering. It turns out my sucpitions about overlapping widgets
	were (hopefully!) wrong. It was easier to debug now that we have a
	YGWizard. The reason of the bug was that we were sending an event when
	the user selected a tree branch and when the YCP asked a branch to
	be selected. The last cause shouldn't happen and causes a cycle (in
	certain YCP applications), which hogs up the CPU at full usage, thus
	the flicker. Amusing enough I repeated the bug on the YGWidget's tree
	implementation. :P I noticed that YGTable also had the same issue :/ (fixed).
	Lesson learned. :)
	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed mentioned bug and a crash on the sorting mechanism
	when clearing rows (like in Table3.ycp example).

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: functional version (just misses
	search and some other glitches yet to fix for basic functionality
	be done -- I have also not tested it much, so...).It features a patch,
	pattern and package selectors. These last both are somewhat integrated.
	It shows a summary dialog (it doesn't yet list dependencies --
	actually, I am don't think those are dealt with, maybe with conflicts
	dialog) and a conflicts dialog. License signing dialog (that some
	packages force) should be working except that there is some mismatch
	between the headers and libraries Zypp versions here on that point
	(the function is there and it compiles fine without warnings, but the
	linker complains), so it is disabled.

	* src/ygtkwizard.c/h: added this base widget for YGWizard and
	YGPackageSelector.

	* HACKING: some Zypp info.

2006-08-08  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: some border fixings.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: tag sizes in proportion to normal font.
	* src/YGWizard.cc: set icon.
	* src/YGDialog.cc: and use it on children dialogs.

	* src/YGPackageSelector.cc: initial code (I am just trying to
	see if I can even print a list of packages with Zypp! :/)

2006-08-03  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLayout.h: don't overload macro operators. This
	should fix macro playing.

2006-08-01  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUI.cc: implemented:
	+ screenshot - Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S

	+ macros - use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M (to start & stop)
	           then Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P (play)
	(not yet working -- looks like we have to do some trick with
	 the events handling to let them pass? Michael, maybe you could
	 check playMacro() on YGUI.cc and respective Qt.)

	+ busy/normal cursor.
	+ some fixes on the file dialogs.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c: added <big>, <small>, <br> and
	set used cursor_new_for_display().

2006-07-31  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: improved layout spacing a bit.
	(to be worked out: some small wizard layout issues.)

	* src/YGLabel.cc: work out output label field to look
	non-editable.

	* src/YGPushButton.cc: use stock icons.

2006-07-30  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: added sortable table support.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c: fixed container border.

	* src/YGWidget.h/cc: added support for borders
	and min sizes.

2006-07-29  Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUtils.cc: simple fix for a crash on tags that
	are not closed (ie. on EOF).

2006-07-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (idleLoop, YGUI, checkInit): do gtk_init
	idly, inside the thread in which we run the gtk+
	mainloop to avoid CORBA confusion with a11y.

2006-07-28 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: setSize() and niceSize() should give
	good values (though things are not yet shining)

	* src/YGDialog.cc: warn/info-dialog option now shows an icon
	at the left rather than a background color.

	* src/YGWidget.cc: set-ed a frameborder  on GtkScrolledWindow,
	which I just noticed that is supported. I was actually putting the
	GtkScrolledWindow inside a GtkFrame on YGWizard... :P (fixed)

2006-07-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (defaultSize): fix default sizing logic.

	* src/YGWizard.cc (YGWizard): use gtk_box_pack_start
	and fix a number of layout issues.

	* src/*.c: remove all g_list_first macros: implicit.

	* src/ygtkratiobox.c (ygtk_ratio_box_init): clean.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CXXFLAGS): set THEMEDIR.
	* src/YGWizard.cc (class YGWizard): use THEMEDIR

	* src/ygtkbargraph.c (ygtk_bar_graph_setup_entry): add
	Tango palette from Jimmac for graphs, order it to get a
	pleasant set of colors first.
	(ygtk_bar_graph_new): use a void prototype

	* src/YGDialog.cc ::YGDialog: remove bogus
	g_object_set causing warning.
	(configure_event_cb): don't setSize if we just moved.

	* TODO: prune tons of cruft.

	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst):
	fix br handling to to clobber 'b' tags.
	
	* src/YGUtils.cc (emit_unclosed_tags_for, tag_entry_new) 
	(tag_entry_free, check_early_close) 
	(ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): complicate royally,
	now handles all the new tests in

	* src/test.cc (testXHtmlConvert): here: cope with unclosed
	<p> and <li>, and generic, un-closed tags.

2006-07-28 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGFrame.cc: follow Gnome HIG (no border, bold label
	and some children identation).

	* src/YGWizard.cc: check for pane movements correctly.

2006-07-27 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkmenubutton.c/h: added this button widget that
	displays a popup when pressed. The popup doesn't have to
	be necessarly of type GtkMenu that it does the work to
	make the thing pop-able.
	* src/YGMenuButton.cc / YGDate: use above.
	* src/ygtkfieldentry.c/h: added this entry that supports
	more than one field (from Baruch Even).
	* src/ygtkspinbox.c/h: replaced by above.

	* src/YGWizard.cc: added pane (there doesn't seem to be a
	way other than connecting its children to size-allocate to
	get pane movements... So this currently does unnecessary work
	on window resizing which is undesirable cause its slow).
	* src/YGWizard.cc: set help box by number of chars in a line,
	not pixels, as suggested by Michael.

2006-07-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUtils.cc (ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): 
	re-work to cope with hr & br tags, add <body> tag if
	no outer tag.
	
	* src/test.cc (testXHtmlConvert): add torture
	tests.

	* src/YGUtils.cc (mapKBAccel): add _ escaping.
	(ygutils_convert_to_xhmlt_and_subst): split to here.

	* src/ygtkrichtext.c (ygtk_richtext_set_text): upd.

	* src/YGUtils.h (YGUtils): add missing dependant
	headers & guards.

	* src/test.cc: simple automated test set for
	'make check', (testMapKBAccel): impl.

	* AUTHORS: set the record straight.

2006-07-26 Ricardo Cruz    <rpcmruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkspinbox.h/c: An extension over GtkSpinButton that
	adds support for more than one field.
	* src/YGTime.cc: implemented YGTime and YGDate.

2006-07-23 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: regression to Michael's code
	(with a couple of fixes) due to instability.

2006-07-18 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: changed look and added sanity checks
	to commands.
	* src/YGAlignment.cc: background image supported.
	* src/YGImage.cc: done.
	* src/ygtksteps.c: added alias steps support and made it
	non-expansible.
	* src/ygtkbargraph.cc: changed mask to fixed colors and chosen
	some.
	* src/YGPartitionSplitter.cc: should be fully operational.
	* src/YGComboBox.cc: implemented maxchars and validchars.
	* src/YGMenuButton.cc: bug fix: popup menu right on button press.
	* src/ygtk_ratio_box.h/c: YGtkRatioBox is now abstract, being instanced
	by *HBox and *VBox. (still using a common size_request/allocate.)
	* src/YGMultiProgressMeter.cc: bug fix: vertical orientation fixed.
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: bug fix: radio buttons behaving too much like
	a toggle button.

2006-07-09 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWizard.cc: first try.

2006-07-07 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.cc: getFixed() can now be overloaded
	and thise
	* src/YGDumbTab.cc: first try.

2006-07-06 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ygtkbargraph.c: moved BarGraph to a Gtk class.
	* src/ygtkslider.c: a more complex gtkscale.
	* src/YGBarGraph.cc: added YGPartitionSplitter.

2006-07-05 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ratiobox.cc renamed to src/ygtkratiobox.cc
	* src/YGMultiProgressMeter.cc: new widget.
	* src/YGProgressBar.cc: added YGDownloadProgress.
	* src/YGBarGraph.cc: first try at writting a Gtk
	class out of it for usage in PartitionSplitter.
	It's broken though. Maybe Michael has a clue on
	the error...

2006-07-04 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/ratiobox.cc: changed size request so that the
	container always has space for the smallest widget.
	Fixed some left space caused by precision losses.
	* YGBarGraph.cc: fixed label text.

2006-07-03 Ricardo Cruz    <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGBarGraph.cc src/ratiobox.cc: added ratio
	container and made bar graph making use of it.
	Still some issues to care.

2006-06-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.cc (class YGGenericLabel): use
	m_inner_widget not m_widget to avoid confusion.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (YGDialog): if opt.hasDefaultSize
	set modal & type hint to dialog; set 'allow_shrink'
	to allow windows to be shrunk.
	(configure_event_cb): listen for configure event,
	use it instead of (size_allocate) nastiness.
	(setSize): get/set defaultSize not size request.

	* src/YGUI.cc (defaultSize): 1st cut.
	(YGUI): parse arguments etc.

	* src/Y2CCGtk.cc: re-indent.

	* src/YGFrame.cc (setSize, nicesize, childAdded):
	bin bogus size calculation for children.

2006-06-24  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* BUGS: added this file that could be used as a notebook
	for issues, so we don't loose track of them. Nothing
	comprehensive or anything...

2006-06-21  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGMenuButton.cc: added support for YMenuButton.

2006-06-19  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (construct): ref/sink the widget
	(~YGWidget): destroy / unref widget when freed.

	* src/YGUI.cc/.h: move boolean flag impls to here
	from the header, beautify header, move cursor
	bits to .cc.

2006-06-17  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGIntField.cc: added YSlider support.

	* src/YGLabel.cc: added YColoredLabel support.

2006-06-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h: added info/warn color.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: cleanups as asked by Michael.

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: added YLogView support.

2006-06-16  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGDialog.h: don't close the window when the user
	presses the window manager close button. Instead report
	it to Yast.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: sub-bullets and numbering should
	be working, as well as sub-"blockquotes".
	And added the link color code suggested by Michael.

2006-06-16  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRichText.cc (rt_end_element): remove debug.
	(setText): fix auto scroll down - we need to use
	gtk_text_view_scroll_to_mark - which queues the scroll
	until mapped/sized etc.

2006-06-15  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGWidget.h: added the emitEvent() method.
	Also did some others of Michael's suggestions.

	* src/YGRichText.cc: added basic bullets.

2006-06-14  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGRichText.cc: added support for hyperlinks.
	I have changed some code ordering (can put it back
	if you don't like...), but the rendering should be
	unchaged. Hyperlink code was adapted from the gtk-demos.

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: changed a couple of things
	that could have been done easier.

	* src/YGImage: initial image support (misses
	tiled and scale-to-fit)

2006-06-13  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTree.cc: changed the attribution of an
	absolute path of GtkTreePath to each YTreeItem,
	that would have to be freed, by the attribute of
	just an index. The path can easily be calculated.
	This should also make it easier if we want that
	setCurrentItem() searches and builds the path
	itself.

	* src/YGTable.cc: fixed a memory leak.

2006-06-09  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTableView.cc (YGMultiSelectionBox):
	should now be working properly.
	The allignment from the YGTable should be fixed
	as well.

	+ addRow() returns the position of the added row
	because sometimes it might not be possible
	to insert it at the intended position.
	This makes MultiSelectionBox example from the
	Yast manual working.

	+ added a getYWidget() to YGWidget so that we
	can make some magic on toggled_cb to avoid
	the previous approach of having a structure
	of pointers (we need to pass YGTableView and
	YMultiSelectionBox...).

2006-06-08  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGUtils: function that converts integers
	to strings gets to see the light at the end of
	the tunnel as it is not used.

2006-06-08  Ricardo Cruz   <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	Made some changes suggested by Michael, mainly the
	move of YGLabeledWidget and YGScrolledWidget to the
	same file of YGWidget.

	* src/YGTree: added set/getCurrentItem() using
	Michael's suggestions. It saves the YTree items
	on a non-visible column for getCurrentItem().
	And it uses data()/setData() from YTreeItems to
	save the GtkTreePath there and retrive it on
	getCurrentItem(). Pretty elegant -- and all examples
	run nicely.

2006-06-08  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc (setInputMaxLength): remove
	bogus pThis usage.

2006-06-07  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTable.cc (itemAdded): fix crash.

2006-06-06 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGMultiLineEdit.cc: implemented the YMultiLineEdit.
	* src/YGScrolledWidget.h/cc: added this new convinience parent
	widget. It is being used by YGMultiLineEdit, YGRichText,
	YGTree and YGTableView derivates.

2006-06-06 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: worked over the YGTableView API and
	made YGSelectBox and YGMultiSelectBox using it.
	(Note: YGTable is segfaulting and toggle buttons on
	 Multi* don't seem to like "activatable" attribute.)

	* src/YGTree.cc: tree now goes inside a GtkScrolledWindow
	which gives it the needed scroll bars.

	* src/YGUI.h: added dialogs to open directories and files.

2006-06-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTable.cc (class YGTable): inherit 1st from
	YTable, and 2nd from YGTableView, so constructors
	get invoked in the right order, and so the
	setWidgetRep works as expected.

2006-06-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* README: simplify list of what works with
	wildcards: helps highlight slightly incomplete bits.

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: Improve signal connection /
	blockage, fix whitespace.
	(class YGCheckBox): impl.

2006-06-04 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabel.cc: worked out; all examples now work.
	* src/YGLabeledWidget.cc: added support for buddies.
	(Notes: YGUtils::setLabel() was removed as it is
	 not needed.)

	* src/YGTree.cc: First implementation
	(misses get/setCurrentItem())

2006-06-03 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGTable.cc: added table support; all
	examples work. But two things still need attention:
	+ I'm not sure what the first letter on the headers
	is supposed to do.
	+ Signal for when the user selects an item isn't
	being sent.
	(unfortunately, inetd or users yast modules aren't
	working near well. But it seems like layout issues.)

2006-06-02  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGReplacePoint.cc, src/YGAlignment.cc,
	* src/YGLayout.cc: merge into YGLayout. Implement
	YSquash as well.
	
	* src/YGSplit.cc, src/YGEmpty.cc, src/YGSpacing.cc,
	* src/YGLayout.cc: merge into YGLayout.

	* src/Makefile.am: update.

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc is now src/YGLabeledWidget.cc

2006-06-02  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.cc (setLabel): add missing chain to parent,
	clean some cruft.

	* ycc.sh: re-work to use the gtk+ option: zenity :-)

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: constructor now is an independent
	woman. This was possible because of gtk_combo_box_set_model().
	setValue() should work, but it's a hack.

2006-06-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGTextEntry.cc (YGTextEntry): use SET_LABEL_CHAIN

	* src/YGComboBox.cc (getComboBox): impl. & use, fix
	whitespace issues, use SET_LABEL_CHAIN

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc (YGLabelWidget): inline (construct),
	set use_underline on the label, fix some whitespace bits.
	Add YGLABEL_WIDGET_IMPL_SET_LABEL_CHAIN.
	(doSetLabel): rename from setLabel.

2006-06-01 Ricardo Cruz <rpmcruz@clix.pt>

	* src/YGLabelWidget.cc/hh: added this convinience
	class that displays a label next to the intended
	widget.

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: workable combo box.
	To do: implement setValue() -- seems far from trivial.
	And add validChars filter -- easy after setValue() done.
	* src/YGTextEntry.cc: fully implemented text entry.
	(Note: I haven't implemented *MultipleChanges() as 
	I think the overhead of it on a single entry text
	widget should not worth it. Qt does the same.)

	* src/YGUtils.cc/hh: added these couple files
	that should have functions shared between classes
	or that just make sense to be in such a file.
	Currently has setLabel() and is_str_valid().
	(Note: setLabel() doesn't yet support buddies.)

	* src/YGWidget.h: added keyboard focus macro.

2006-05-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc: remove createComboBox

	* src/YGComboBox.cc: move it here, implement a noddy
	skeleton.

2006-05-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRadioButton.cc (setValue): block signals to
	avoid supurious events: fixes RadioButton1
	
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc (getCheckRadioButtonType):
	remove bus-load of debug, angst & crud. Kill elusive
	crasher (gdb was lying), sub-class GtkRadioButton to
	make behavior more Qt-like.

2006-05-27  Michael Meeks  <michael@>

	* src/YGSelectionBox.cc: add - stub for timezone
	selector. YGSquash.cc needed next: should be simple -
	go Ricardo go ! ;-)

	* src/Makefile.am (libpy2gtk_la_SOURCES): add
	YGSelectionBox.cc

	* src/YGWidget.cc: tag YGWIDGET_DUFF_LAYOUT & remove
	the crufty guff trying to fixup some issues.
	(clobbered_size_allocate, dynamic_subtype, moveWidget):
	remove.

	* test.sh: helpful script for testing.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (YGDialog): remove set_default_size
	causing grief.

	* src/YGSplit.cc (class YGSplit): use new
	SET_SIZE_CHAIN - all 'Fixed' containers should do
	this.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (setSize): remove horrible hack
	to trap set_size_request -> size_allocate -> ~ loop,
	much cleaner now.

2006-05-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* configure.in: use PKG_CHECK_MODULES, fixes odd
	64bit problem.

	* autogen.sh: pass --libdir inferred from
	yast2-devtools libdir: fixes 64bit foo; don't set
	the wrong PKG_CONFIG_PATH unless we have nothing to
	go on.

2006-05-25  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* README, yast2.txt: update & clarify.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getNiceSize): remove ugly
	hack, and emit 'size_request' signal ourselves 
	to avoid need for hack.

2006-05-25  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* commit to Novell forge CVS: thanks kobliha

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getNiceSize): remove ugly
	hack, and emit 'size_request' signal ourselves 
	to avoid need for hack.

2006-05-17  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc: fix setSize

	* src/YGWidget.cc: revert to old-style layout
	again, forgotten the (good?) reasons for the pain.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (YGWidget): if (!show) - toplevel
	window: don't much about with 'size_allocate'
	sub-classing: fixes window sizing issues.

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (doMoveChild): impl. as a method.
	(do_size_allocate): factor out of (doSetSize).
	(doMoveChild): act on the child's allocation not ours.
	Works rather nicely (now).

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (clobbered_size_allocate): impl.
	(doSetSize): impl. add CLOBBER_SIZE_ALLOCATE control,
	default to off. Just need some more work on custom
	GtkAllocation manipulation by containers.

2006-05-06  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGWidget.cc (YGWidget): add 'hack here'
	goodness.
	(dynamic_subtype): create dynamic sub-type & clobber
	size_allocate.
	(clobbered_size_allocate): this needs to be able
	to filter out individual widgets [ via g_object_data ? ]
	to allow individual size allocations to be performed
	without the rest of the children getting them too.

	* src/YGWidget.[ch]: re-factor constructor to take
	'type' & construction time args; this will allow a
	dynamic sub-classing to happen there to allow
	clobbering of size_request/allocate [etc.]
	* src/*: update to fit.
	* src/YGImage.c: clobber for now.

2006-04-13  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGFrame.cc, src/YGImage.cc: add
	* src/YGRadioButton.cc: add - something badly
	wrong with destruction logic though.

2006-04-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGDialog.cc: fold YGDialog.h in.

	* src/YGUI.cc: impl. get screen dimensions /
	default size etc.

2006-04-05  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (idleLoop): set NULL encoding.

	* src/YGRichText.cc (YGRichText): impl.

2006-04-04  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGPushButton.cc, src/YGUI.cc: move.

2006-04-01  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGRichText.cc: stubbed.

2006-03-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.cc (YGUI): call 'topmostConstructorHasFinished'
	(idleLoop, ycp_wakeup_fn): deal with fd_ycp properly.

2006-03-30  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGLabel.h, src/YGSplit.h: remove.

	* src/YGTextEntry.cc: partial impl.

	* src/YGSpacing.cc, src/YGReplacePoint.cc,
	* src/YGProgressBar.cc, src/YGEmpty.cc: impl.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (show): impl.

2006-03-29  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* configure.in: catch non /usr prefixes.

	* src/YGWidget.cc (getFixed): walk up widget hierarchy
	first looking for 'Fixed's.

	* src/YGSplit.cc (YGSplit): also a GtkFixed - we need
	a nested hierarchy of Fixed it seems.

2006-03-28  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGUI.h (ui): fix silly infinite recursion,
	click the button to exit now works.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (nicesize): fix sizing.

2006-03-27  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* src/YGSplit.h: remove bogus niceSize impl causing
	difficulties.

	* src/YGUI.cc (dumpWidgetTree, dumpYastTree): expose.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (nicesize): remove hack /crop to
	max 50 pixels large.

	* src/YGWidget.h (getWidgetName): return better names.

	* src/YGDialog.cc (setSize, ygdialog_size_allocate):
	make dynamic sizing work better (can grow at least)

	* yast2.txt: helpful devel. pointers.

	* configure.in, src/*: add some code.

	* Import personal play-ground of no real value.

	* Please feal extremely free to commit
	  tasteful bug fixes
