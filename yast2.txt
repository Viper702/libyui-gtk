* Code notes:

/usr/include/YaST2/yui/YUI.h
	+ main factory class interface.

Implementation split over several files:

YQUI_widgets.cc:
	+ all the 'createFoo' methods
YQUI_x11.cc:
	+ cursor / font / some event bits
YQUI_builtins.cc:
	+ builtin dialogs etc.
YQUI_core.cc:
	+ constructor / init / arg parsing
	+ mainloop etc.
	+ 'YQUI::easterEgg'

* Short term goals:

** beef up test.sh to improve layout: add -geometry argument ?

** /usr/share/YaST2/clients/bootloader.ycp
    + works quite nicely...
    + needs scroll bars

** RichText
    + needs scroll-bar / adjustments ...

** /usr/share/YaST2/clients/timezone.ycp


+ createImage:
    + 'tiled' ?

** Layout issue(s)

    + The best-guess solution here is to understand yast2-qt better
      and (perhaps) abandon the funky new YGWIDGET_NEW_LAYOUT
    + This means we must clobber the resizing mess:
	+ that gets spawned from 'gtk_fixed' when anything is moved.
	+ with our own GtkFixed sub-class -perhaps- we can simply not
	  trigger a resize on movement.
	+ OTOH - we do want to re-trigger a size_allocate to
	  actually move the GtkFixed children

    + In short more analysis of Gtk / Qt sizing & YaST2 sizing needed
	+ & in conclusion - ~none of our container widgets should be
	  using Gtk+ size_requests - but native implemented ones.

* Yast2 sizing:	
    + setSize - recurses down from the 'top' to the bottom widgets
	+ for contained widgets - it triggers pairs of:
	    + setSize, moveChild calls.

* Gtk sizing:
    + gtksizegroup.c:
	+ code always emits the gtk+ size_request signal
	  [ which we should prolly emit ourselves incidentally ]
	+ GtkWidgetAuxInfo's clobbered 'width' / 'height' that
	  override the requisition information

+ Frame ...
    + src/Frame2.ycp ...
    + The problem is:
	+ the Gtk+ containment hierarcy:
	    + trying to do our own size allocate / etc.
		+ our own 'size request' ? ...
	    + is it going to work ?
	    + do we need to derive from & clobber all widgets'
	      'size_allocate' ?
	    + [ and just use our own (evil) versions ]

	+ Since Yast2 has it's own ideas:
	    + perhaps 'setSize' should do just that:
		+ hook to 'size_allocate'
	+ use size requests for calculating other
	  things, not this (?)

++ New layout logic:
    + re-factor to use a single top-level 'GtkFixed' thing.
    + [ !? layering ? - flicker & child windows etc.
        : no-window widgets fine but [events?] ... ]
    + setSize - comes down from the 'top' to the bottom widgets
	+ for contained widgets - it triggers pairs of:
	    + setSize, moveChild calls.
