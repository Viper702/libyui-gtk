List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues:

= Yast-GTK =

* ComboBox
	o must implement SetValue() and filter
		We may use gtk_bin_get_child().
		To be discussed.

* MenuButton
	o Popup-menu only appears on button click.
		Should appear right when pressed.
		Trivial, just needs some time.

* RichText
	o we need to add table support for the package selector.
		Might be nice to use GtkHtml, if available.

* IntField / Slider
	o should only report value change when the widget is stalled.
		To use g_idle functionality.

* Shrinkable option
	o Maybe add some macro for that.
		Some widgets need to report a different nice size than Gtk,
		like with some margin. To be looked together.

* Auto-yast flickering
	after changing modules. To be investigated.

* Image
	Misses scaling and tiling.
	Cairo API might be the 

* Auto-Yast
	o Flickering
	Just clicking around results on it.
	To be investigated.

= Yast-Core =

* Crash on example Tree3.ycp
	It's because somehow it assumes tree id to be a string when
	it is something else, causing an assert fault.
	Would be nice to make an actual patch for Yast guys.

* ColorLabel change value
	There should be a setColor() API on the frontend instead of Yast-core
	trying to implement that itself by removing the label and creating
	another.

* Stock images for buttons
	If the ids that YCP apps give have any meaning we might be able to
	just use those...
