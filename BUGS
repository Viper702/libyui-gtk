List of missing features, actual bugs and other issues:

= Yast-GTK =

* RichText
	o we need to add table support for the package selector.
		Might be nice to use GtkHtml, if available.

* IntField / Slider
	o should only report value change when the widget is stalled.
		To use g_idle functionality.

* Shrinkable option
	o Maybe add some macro for that.
		Some widgets need to report a different nice size than Gtk,
		like with some margin. To be looked together.

* Auto-yast flickering
	after changing modules. To be investigated.

* Auto-Yast
	o Flickering
	Just clicking around results on it.
	To be investigated.

* BarGraph
	Colors should follow user-defined tons,
	maybe based on Evolution's calendar.

* MultiProgressBar
	Doesn't work well on vertical.

* RadioButton
	Shouldn't behave completely like a push button.

= Yast-Core =

* Crash on example Tree3.ycp
	It's because somehow it assumes tree id to be a string when
	it is something else, causing an assert fault.
	Would be nice to make an actual patch for Yast guys.

* It has been reported that a 80Mb computer is able to proceed during
  all the text mode installation process, but the partition custom
  setup. I suspect this is due to the Yast-core table and not really
  ncurses'. Something that might be nice to see together with the previous
  point... For more information, contact jdd@dodin.org .

* ColorLabel change value
	There should be a setColor() API on the frontend instead of Yast-core
	trying to implement that itself by removing the label and creating
	another.

* Stock images for buttons
	If the ids that YCP apps give have any meaning we might be able to
	just use those...
